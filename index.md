### Announcements: <a name="announcements-link"></a>

<p class="message">
<strong>My LinkedIn is currently hibernating.</strong>
<br>If you need to reach out - feel free to <a href="mailto:info.konham@gmail.com">email me</a>. (info.konham@gmail.com)
<br><br>
<strong>I'm currently mentoring about about 20 students learning either Ruby on Rails or 'Intro to Programming'.</strong><br>This not-for-profit organization focuses on teaching tech skills to people from diverse backgrounds (underrepresented, historically exluded, and/or folks from immigrant backgrounds) - all for free and powered by volunteers like me (and perhaps you)! It's a great mission that is very close to my heart. Check out <a href="https://codethedream.org">Code the Dream!</a>

### My Current Coding Project(s): <a name="my-current-coding-projects-link"></a>

 - **Learning Python**. I'm exploring Python via ['100 Days of Python'](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 
 
   Here's the Github [link](https://github.com/kon-ham/100_days_of_python).

 - **KnewHarvest** is a web-application that tracks a user's plant crops from seed to harvest. Authors of this application work closely in collaboration with end-user by implementing Agile methodology. MVP and sprint runs are utilized. End-user provides feedback with each sprint-run. Features are built incrementally. All authors work remotely and are located in three separate timezones. 

    This project is a practice in building an application in which goals and final deadlines are unknown. The authors of this application build small, iteratively, and collaboratively. Deliberate practice in async communications for standups and check-ins. Project board utilized to track user stories as well as progress of tasks and features. 

    We're currently using: Tailwind CSS and Rails.

    Check out the current status of this project [here](https://github.com/wdk3)!
