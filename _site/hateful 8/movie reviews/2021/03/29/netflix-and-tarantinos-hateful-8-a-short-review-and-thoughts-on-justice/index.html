  <p>The series is long. It’s absolutely a tour de force in the celebration of gore, violence, and hate. I finished it, despite the derogatory words eventually becoming tiresome to me.</p>

<p>I did have a thought on justice, though.</p>

<p>Ms. Demergue eventually does hang, but she hangs by Captain Mannix, who was to be the sheriff of the town of Red Rock where Ms. Demergue was to hang.</p>

<p>Though Mannix had not completed his ceremonies to be sworn in as a sheriff, he was appointed as “sheriff-to-be” by law or ordinance.</p>

<p>Ms. Demergue was a diabolical woman. However, it would have been wrong to have enacted mob justice by killing her on the spot. Justice must be carried out by mandated authorities. When we have a rule-of-mob law, anarchy and injustice reigns.</p>

<p>There must be order in this world, and in better times, those authorities placed above us must carry out justice, or all of society suffers.</p>

<p>Ms. Demergue did hang and it was done appropriately by Capt. Mannix.</p>

<p>Even in a blood soaked room with corpses strewn about – order, structure, and even justice can be had, if we are willing to do things the right way.</p>
