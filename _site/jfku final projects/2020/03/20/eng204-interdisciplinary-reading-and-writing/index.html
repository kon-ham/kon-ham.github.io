<meta name="description" content="Those in business management must factor in the element of human action when structuring change in policies or organization in the business. In order to understand the impact of human action upon those in the business management world, it is first important to define what a manager is. According to Mises, a manager is “a junior partner of the entrepreneur, as it were, no matter what the contractual and financial terms of his employment are.” (Mises, 2009) Mises makes a strong distinction between the entrepreneur and the manager. Here in “Human Action”, entrepreneurs predict future market trends by allocating capital towards those market trends in the hopes of profit. The entrepreneur, according to Mises, controls the factors of production. (Mises, 2009) Then, what factor does the role of human action play in the day to day decisions of a business manager? It is the desire of human consumption through wants and needs that are the driving forces of what keeps both the entrepreneur alive and thereby pays the manager a salary. It is the action of humans that drives forward business to new heights. It is assumed that business assessments to which managers and entrepreneurs make decisions are based upon facts and only facts – however that does not sufficiently explain the hysteria of a boom-bust cycle of a business and why people tend to buy emotionally and afterwards to justify their decisions based upon so called logical factors. (Lesly, 1965) If then human action impacts business cycles and stock market prices, consider office politics and other related forms of human interaction that cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers and facts. How can you factor in the variable of a man or woman who is having an affair with another colleague? These variables are all considerations that are based upon human action. And human action cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers. Then can human action be predictable for business managers? Most certainly. That is why businesses evolve policies and guidelines to hedge against unknown variables such as sexual harassment problems within the workplace as well as business cycles. However, the solution becomes a problem when companies religiously believe that it is the mere policies and guidelines of a company that can prevent the behavior completely or to change the behavior of a person completely or the belief that if a company just has enough data that it would therefore be able to make perfect decisions. It is the same mistaken assumption in creating a product for the market in which consumers have no interest in. You cannot mold the desire of the market but rather the manager and entrepreneur must conform to it. There appears to be a trend towards computerizing human desire as well as market trends. (Lesly, 1965) That is, the belief that human desire and action can be quantified and classified. But this is true only to a certain extent. Man has long known that there are basic desires of humanity that will never change and will always remain. Food, sex, shelter, respect for peers, and so on along the Maslow hierarchy of needs. But it is the manifestation of those desires into human action that is unpredictable and unclassifiable. Who knew that during the 1950’s so many products and gadgets would have come to fruition eventually coining the design term “Populuxe” — that products would be a manifestation of a philosophy and outlook upon life? If man’s needs were basic and man only bought products to satisfy those needs, then a man would not purchase a V8 400 horsepower car but rather would just purchase a car with specifications just enough to allow for him to grow into a family, should he so desire. Instead though, man has shown through the purchase of products and the decisions of his actions that he chooses products based on, yes, a desire to fulfill a basic need but the actions of his fulfillment of his needs are much more complicated than a manager would want to admit. Marketing and advertising has long pined after the holy grail of prophecy of human action. But the best marketers and advertisers can only test the market. And from there they can only improve the product to best fit the needs of the market. It is possibly, from the author’s speculation, the reason behind the mass computerization of human action into data. But although the brain has patterns of commonality with the computer, it is not a computer. Human action may be based upon logic, but it seems rather a justification of emotional purchases or decisions. This is not to say that humans are irrational beings. It is the whole work of Mises and the Austrian School of Economics that defines human action as praxeology, or, the study of purposeful human action. It is the mass of purposeful human action by people that creates market demand and destroys it. And it is the mass of purposeful human action that dictates the productivity of the work environment of a business. Lesly is quoted, “Carried to an extreme, efforts to computerize business judgements, in a world run by human attitudes, create their own defeats. They squeeze out the unique and the original, because things or ideas that have not existed before tend to be “vague” and cannot be measured. They solidify the positions of organization men and smother ideas from the outside. They reward the superficial because it can be measured. Albert Einstein, who is usually considered this century’s epitome of the precise computer-like mind, said in “Out of My Later Years”: “Perfect of means and confusion of goals seem—in my opinion—to characterize our age.” (Lesly, 1965) Essentially, the rush behind the computerizing of data was an attempt to hedge risk for the entrepreneur, and to make the life of a manager easier. And the fruit of computerizing data was hugely successful, there should be no doubt. The ancients and even those who lived in the world of business just 30 years prior would have longed for the technology we possess now in our hands. Before the advent of cheap data allocation and storage, business leaders had adopted whatever tools and technologies available to maximize efficiency and profits and to make better decisions in the face of incomplete information and the general fog of war that comes with making decisions and creating policies. From the Renaissance’s Girolamo Cardano to game theory’s John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, the idea behind such “unpredictable” factors went from the concept of mere probability to quantifying of the so called random actions of people in “which deals in situations where people’s decisions are influenced by the unknowable decisions of “live variables” (aka other people)” (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Neither can business-based management thrive on a mythical or spiritual concept of human action based decisions. There are many business leaders who rely on mere “gut instinct”, which to some explains largely the success of gut based leaders like George Soros and Jack Welch. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Harvard Business Review is correct. The brain/gut dichotomy is false. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Business managers cannot thrive on just one form of decision making. But this common fallacy of the dichotomy of brain and gut exists as a result of the current inability to mediate between the two regions of the “styles” of leadership and decision making. It appears that the human action element also plays a consistent role in the perception of management as well. How can you quantify a manager who does not appear to be sure of himself or herself and therefore becoming uninspiring of confidence? Ejimabo goes so far as to defining the terms of leadership and decision making—of the many different ideas of the concept of leadership and decision making it seems clear the general idea of leadership and decision making universally accepted but one definition of the term of leadership seemed appropriate for the topic here. “Leadership is a process of giving purpose (meaningful direction) to collective effort, and causing willing effort to be expended to achieve purpose” (Ejimabo, 2017) Furthermore, Ejimabo’s study of the influence of decision making and business management finds that the business manager must somehow find a place for humanity in the light of all the information that is processed daily. What sort of relationship does the manager hold with his or her team? And what sort of relationship does the manager hold with the entrepreneur? Does the manager listen effectively? All of the basic elements of the respect of the human being appear to lead teams to prosperity. McCaffrey suggest that Sun Tzu’s Art of War is rooted in economic thought (McCaffrey, 2014) – and the most important concept of Art of War is that you must know your enemy. This concept can be drawn from both knowing the competition as well as the market and as well as knowing who those are that you are leading. Obviously the information drawn from the battlefield of economic warfare and from human resources is important but to view these forces as mere cause and effect is to be reactionary, not revolutionary. Of course, in the business world this guiding of purposeful action through effective listening and relationship building is known as mere communication but it is much more than that. The communication is just the medium through which one human being navigates through others. If the communication is the ship then purposeful human action is the wind, the sea, the sun, and the moon—the raw form of nature that holds the ship at her mercy. So then business managers who manage ideally and effectively are ones who lead with purposeful direction. Once again we return to the impact of purposeful human action in the realm of business and management. Business managers must fully comprehend the importance and impact that purposeful human action has on decision making and policies. And it is from this perspective that managers must make decisions, as well as factoring in computerized data and the “gut” feeling. This is quite the challenge in the face of modern business. Transactions are now processed in mere seconds and information is relayed even quicker. Now a decision made in London can be processed in New York City within a blink of an eye. And now due to the globalization of business, managers now encounter new challenges such as working with persons of different cultures as well as the confounding issue of ethics and morals in an ever changing world. The concepts that business leaders relied upon a mere five years ago may no longer be relevant in the new information age. And how can a manager plan for problems that are unrelated to the business? For instance, a laborer under a manager that marries a coworker or an employee that is contributing to a “hostile work environment”? How shall a manager account for human resource biases in the hiring of new employees? Should human resources hire for diversity over raw skills and talents? The problem then is what a manager can do in the light of all the new information that piles up on a manager’s desk. What information is worth the precious time to evaluate? And how can the manager make even quicker decisions in the face of all of the information that is passed onto him or her? Once again I propose filtering of that information in terms of what the information reveals in purposeful human action. It is the purposeful human action that drives or kills a market or a business and it is the basis of human action that leads a company to either success or to failure. Leaders, as Ejimabo states, are those who can influence others into purposeful human action, and such a skill requires the understanding that humans to be lead are first to be recognized as human beings who each have their own interests in life. A manager for example is motivated to increase profits for the company because the entrepreneur will then instead find another manager who can do the job more successfully. To summarize then, what are the main points of this essay? First, it is that humans are not necessarily irrational creatures. Proof of this is in the modern hysteria in the attempt to collect all information possible to predict future behavior. Human behavior can be predicted – but only in the sense that needs of humans are consistent, and that these needs are acted out in purposeful behavior. How that behavior is manifested is dependent upon the individual. Second, it is that humans are not irrational creatures because of the basis of purposeful human action. This purposeful action is what drives all of the forces of the market as well as the interactions between manager and laborer and entrepreneur. This purposeful human action accounts for the problems and solutions of the business world. How shall an organization move forward with office politics or with the problem of innovation? These problems arise as a result of humans seeking what is in their best interest, or to the highest purpose of their actions. Obviously a vacuum of direction exists within the realm of office politics which gives way for laborers to seek out interests not in the best interest of the business. What of the problem of slowing innovation and creativity? There are many causes to this but it boils down to the lack of initiative taken by managers and laborers because of a lack of a variety of different motivators. These people have found it more purposeful to stay in the shadows and to “stay quiet”. Third, it is the responsibility of the manager, within the context of the junior associate of the entrepreneur, to work within his or her means to produce profits by the guiding of the purposeful human action into productivity. This means the shaping of specific policies that are grounded in the reality that is purposeful human action. Policies that are shaped in the back rooms of a management only office cannot account for all of the different variables that come into play in the business world. This is why a solid steering of direction must be set into place and obstacles overcome with the filtering of information through the eyes of purposeful human action. A sheltered company with sheltered managers who are blindly shaping policy and procedures will not survive in the long term and especially in the inevitable bust cycle of business. Managers must constantly be aware of the human action factor that plays a role in all of the movements of the world.

Before the advent of cheap data allocation and storage, business leaders had adopted whatever tools and technologies available to maximize efficiency and profits and to make better decisions in the face of incomplete information and the general fog of war that comes with making decisions and creating policies. From the Renaissance’s Girolamo Cardano to game theory’s John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, the idea behind such “unpredictable” factors went from the concept of mere probability to quantifying of the so called random actions of people in “which deals in situations where people’s decisions are influenced by the unknowable decisions of “live variables” (aka other people)” (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Neither can business-based management thrive on a mythical or spiritual concept of human action based decisions. There are many business leaders who rely on mere “gut instinct”, which to some explains largely the success of gut based leaders like George Soros and Jack Welch. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Harvard Business Review is correct. The brain/gut dichotomy is false. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Business managers cannot thrive on just one form of decision making. But this common fallacy of the dichotomy of brain and gut exists as a result of the current inability to mediate between the two regions of the “styles” of leadership and decision making. It appears that the human action element also plays a consistent role in the perception of management as well. How can you quantify a manager who does not appear to be sure of himself or herself and therefore becoming uninspiring of confidence? Ejimabo goes so far as to defining the terms of leadership and decision making—of the many different ideas of the concept of leadership and decision making it seems clear the general idea of leadership and decision making universally accepted but one definition of the term of leadership seemed appropriate for the topic here. “Leadership is a process of giving purpose (meaningful direction) to collective effort, and causing willing effort to be expended to achieve purpose” (Ejimabo, 2017) Furthermore, Ejimabo’s study of the influence of decision making and business management finds that the business manager must somehow find a place for humanity in the light of all the information that is processed daily. What sort of relationship does the manager hold with his or her team? And what sort of relationship does the manager hold with the entrepreneur? Does the manager listen effectively? All of the basic elements of the respect of the human being appear to lead teams to prosperity. McCaffrey suggest that Sun Tzu’s Art of War is rooted in economic thought (McCaffrey, 2014) – and the most important concept of Art of War is that you must know your enemy. This concept can be drawn from both knowing the competition as well as the market and as well as knowing who those are that you are leading. Obviously the information drawn from the battlefield of economic warfare and from human resources is important but to view these forces as mere cause and effect is to be reactionary, not revolutionary. Of course, in the business world this guiding of purposeful action through effective listening and relationship building is known as mere communication but it is much more than that. The communication is just the medium through which one human being navigates through others. If the communication is the ship then purposeful human action is the wind, the sea, the sun, and the moon—the raw form of nature that holds the ship at her mercy. So then business managers who manage ideally and effectively are ones who lead with purposeful direction. Once again we return to the impact of purposeful human action in the realm of business and management. Business managers must fully comprehend the importance and impact that purposeful human action has on decision making and policies. And it is from this perspective that managers must make decisions, as well as factoring in computerized data and the “gut” feeling. This is quite the challenge in the face of modern business. Transactions are now processed in mere seconds and information is relayed even quicker. Now a decision made in London can be processed in New York City within a blink of an eye. And now due to the globalization of business, managers now encounter new challenges such as working with persons of different cultures as well as the confounding issue of ethics and morals in an ever changing world. The concepts that business leaders relied upon a mere five years ago may no longer be relevant in the new information age. And how can a manager plan for problems that are unrelated to the business? For instance, a laborer under a manager that marries a coworker or an employee that is contributing to a “hostile work environment”? How shall a manager account for human resource biases in the hiring of new employees? Should human resources hire for diversity over raw skills and talents? The problem then is what a manager can do in the light of all the new information that piles up on a manager’s desk. What information is worth the precious time to evaluate? And how can the manager make even quicker decisions in the face of all of the information that is passed onto him or her? Once again I propose filtering of that information in terms of what the information reveals in purposeful human action. It is the purposeful human action that drives or kills a market or a business and it is the basis of human action that leads a company to either success or to failure. Leaders, as Ejimabo states, are those who can influence others into purposeful human action, and such a skill requires the understanding that humans to be lead are first to be recognized as human beings who each have their own interests in life. A manager for example is motivated to increase profits for the company because the entrepreneur will then instead find another manager who can do the job more successfully. To summarize then, what are the main points of this essay? First, it is that humans are not necessarily irrational creatures. Proof of this is in the modern hysteria in the attempt to collect all information possible to predict future behavior. Human behavior can be predicted – but only in the sense that needs of humans are consistent, and that these needs are acted out in purposeful behavior. How that behavior is manifested is dependent upon the individual. Second, it is that humans are not irrational creatures because of the basis of purposeful human action. This purposeful action is what drives all of the forces of the market as well as the interactions between manager and laborer and entrepreneur. This purposeful human action accounts for the problems and solutions of the business world. How shall an organization move forward with office politics or with the problem of innovation? These problems arise as a result of humans seeking what is in their best interest, or to the highest purpose of their actions. Obviously a vacuum of direction exists within the realm of office politics which gives way for laborers to seek out interests not in the best interest of the business. What of the problem of slowing innovation and creativity? There are many causes to this but it boils down to the lack of initiative taken by managers and laborers because of a lack of a variety of different motivators. These people have found it more purposeful to stay in the shadows and to “stay quiet”. Third, it is the responsibility of the manager, within the context of the junior associate of the entrepreneur, to work within his or her means to produce profits by the guiding of the purposeful human action into productivity. This means the shaping of specific policies that are grounded in the reality that is purposeful human action. Policies that are shaped in the back rooms of a management only office cannot account for all of the different variables that come into play in the business world. This is why a solid steering of direction must be set into place and obstacles overcome with the filtering of information through the eyes of purposeful human action. A sheltered company with sheltered managers who are blindly shaping policy and procedures will not survive in the long term and especially in the inevitable bust cycle of business. Managers must constantly be aware of the human action factor that plays a role in all of the movements of the world.

  <p>Those in business management must factor in the element of human action when structuring change in policies or organization in the business. In order to understand the impact of human action upon those in the business management world, it is first important to define what a manager is. According to Mises, a manager is “a junior partner of the entrepreneur, as it were, no matter what the contractual and financial terms of his employment are.” (Mises, 2009) Mises makes a strong distinction between the entrepreneur and the manager. Here in “Human Action”, entrepreneurs predict future market trends by allocating capital towards those market trends in the hopes of profit. The entrepreneur, according to Mises, controls the factors of production. (Mises, 2009)<br />
Then, what factor does the role of human action play in the day to day decisions of a business manager? It is the desire of human consumption through wants and needs that are the driving forces of what keeps both the entrepreneur alive and thereby pays the manager a salary. It is the action of humans that drives forward business to new heights. It is assumed that business assessments to which managers and entrepreneurs make decisions are based upon facts and only facts – however that does not sufficiently explain the hysteria of a boom-bust cycle of a business and why people tend to buy emotionally and afterwards to justify their decisions based upon so called logical factors. (Lesly, 1965) If then human action impacts business cycles and stock market prices, consider office politics and other related forms of human interaction that cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers and facts. How can you factor in the variable of a man or woman who is having an affair with another colleague? These variables are all considerations that are based upon human action. And human action cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers.<br />
Then can human action be predictable for business managers? Most certainly. That is why businesses evolve policies and guidelines to hedge against unknown variables such as sexual harassment problems within the workplace as well as business cycles. However, the solution becomes a problem when companies religiously believe that it is the mere policies and guidelines of a company that can prevent the behavior completely or to change the behavior of a person completely or the belief that if a company just has enough data that it would therefore be able to make perfect decisions. It is the same mistaken assumption in creating a product for the market in which consumers have no interest in. You cannot mold the desire of the market but rather the manager and entrepreneur must conform to it.<br />
There appears to be a trend towards computerizing human desire as well as market trends. (Lesly, 1965) That is, the belief that human desire and action can be quantified and classified. But this is true only to a certain extent. Man has long known that there are basic desires of humanity that will never change and will always remain. Food, sex, shelter, respect for peers, and so on along the Maslow hierarchy of needs. But it is the manifestation of those desires into human action that is unpredictable and unclassifiable. Who knew that during the 1950’s so many products and gadgets would have come to fruition eventually coining the design term “Populuxe” — that products would be a manifestation of a philosophy and outlook upon life? If man’s needs were basic and man only bought products to satisfy those needs, then a man would not purchase a V8 400 horsepower car but rather would just purchase a car with specifications just enough to allow for him to grow into a family, should he so desire. Instead though, man has shown through the purchase of products and the decisions of his actions that he chooses products based on, yes, a desire to fulfill a basic need but the actions of his fulfillment of his needs are much more complicated than a manager would want to admit.<br />
Marketing and advertising has long pined after the holy grail of prophecy of human action. But the best marketers and advertisers can only test the market. And from there they can only improve the product to best fit the needs of the market. It is possibly, from the author’s speculation, the reason behind the mass computerization of human action into data. But although the brain has patterns of commonality with the computer, it is not a computer. Human action may be based upon logic, but it seems rather a justification of emotional purchases or decisions. This is not to say that humans are irrational beings. It is the whole work of Mises and the Austrian School of Economics that defines human action as praxeology, or, the study of purposeful human action. It is the mass of purposeful human action by people that creates market demand and destroys it. And it is the mass of purposeful human action that dictates the productivity of the work environment of a business.<br />
Lesly is quoted,<br />
“Carried to an extreme, efforts to computerize business judgements, in a world run by human attitudes, create their own defeats. They squeeze out the unique and the original, because things or ideas that have not existed before tend to be “vague” and cannot be measured. They solidify the positions of organization men and smother ideas from the outside. They reward the superficial because it can be measured. Albert Einstein, who is usually considered this century’s epitome of the precise computer-like mind, said in “Out of My Later Years”: “Perfect of means and confusion of goals seem—in my opinion—to characterize our age.” (Lesly, 1965)<br />
Essentially, the rush behind the computerizing of data was an attempt to hedge risk for the entrepreneur, and to make the life of a manager easier. And the fruit of computerizing data was hugely successful, there should be no doubt. The ancients and even those who lived in the world of business just 30 years prior would have longed for the technology we possess now in our hands. Before the advent of cheap data allocation and storage, business leaders had adopted whatever tools and technologies available to maximize efficiency and profits and to make better decisions in the face of incomplete information and the general fog of war that comes with making decisions and creating policies.
