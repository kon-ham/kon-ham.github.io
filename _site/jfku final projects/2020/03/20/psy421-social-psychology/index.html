<meta name="description" content="Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology I Andy is the owner of the many toys that appear to “live” in Andy’s room. Many of them appear to enjoy their roles as toys. And there is obviously a sense or understanding of inevitable favoritism by Andy. For Andy, Woody was Andy’s favorite toy for some time. Generally, there is not much in the room of anxiety or conflict until Andy’s birthday party arrives, in which the toys greatly fear that they will be replaced by a new toy. Woody tries to calm the toys but the toys still relent with anxiety. Mr. Potato Head goes so far as to say “Of course Woody ain’t worried! He’s been Andy’s favorite since kindergarten!” It also appears to be that the toys view Woody as the toy that leads and directs, mostly exhibited by the ability of Woody to gain the compliance of the toy soldiers. The toys in their anxiety send out the soldier toys in order to spy on the events that transpire during the party that they might be able to see what arrives in the presents that the party attendees gift to Andy. The gifts received are irrelevant to the toys in that the gifts are toys that do not seem to exhibit any ability to be autonomous, i.e., a lunch box and a Battle Ships board game. Finally, when all looks clear for the toys, Andy’s mother pulls out a surprise gift, which is a new toy. The toys that collectively call themselves “Andy’s toys” are what social psychology calls a group. A group is “an aggregate of individuals who interact with and influence one another.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, Bordens and Horowitz use the example of a bus stop and the number of people that wait at that bus stop. These people are not a group because they are not “truly influencing each other” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) and they only interact with each other “on a basic level”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Andy’s toys appear to spend a great deal of time together. In fact, these toys individually refer to themselves as Andy’s toys. These toys appear to play together when Andy is not around – Woody is asked to play checkers by Slinky and Buzz Lightyear brushes the hair of the pink troll. The amount of influence they have on each other is conveyed with Woody announces to the other toys that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to today. The toys collectively influence each other in that they all begin an outbreak of anxiety and fear that they will be replaced by a newer toy. Social psychology refers to two types of groups. One is an instrumental group and another is an affiliate group. I propose that both groups have relevancy in Toy Story concerning Andy’s toys. An instrumental group is referred to as groups that exist to “perform some task or reach some specific goal.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) With the exception of Buzz Lightyear, the toys have an understanding that they are indeed toys and that they serve Andy as his toys. An affiliate group is known as a group that exists on a more general level and often for social means. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Though the toys had no choice in the matter of becoming Andy’s toy, they take joy in this and also socialize with each other whenever Andy is not at home. There are also group norms associated with Andy’s toys. Group norms are defined as “expectations concerning the kinds of behaviors required of group members”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) On one level they appear to exhibit a basic understanding of morality. Death is not explicitly implied in this movie, however the toys become upset when they assume Woody to be responsible for Buzz falling out of the window. There is another scene where Woody is trying to convince the toys that they ought to assist Woody and Buzz with escaping Sid’s house – Woody uses Buzz’s arm to appear to convey that Buzz is fine. When the toys see through the illusion, Rex the dinosaur appears to gag at the thought of Woody carrying around Buzz’s arm. Furthermore, before the appearance of Buzz Lightyear, it was generally assumed that Woody was Andy’s favorite toy. It appears to be that because Woody is Andy’s favorite toy that he takes a commanding role over the other toys. Furthermore, the toys seem to have their own spot in Andy’s room – Woody’s spot was on Andy’s bed. There also appears to be interdependency between the toys. That is, they need each other. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toy soldiers work together in conjunction with the other toys to spy on the birthday party. Each of the toys seek out moving partner in order to prevent being lost in the moving process. These points clearly indicate in a social psychological perspective that Andy’s toys are collectively a group. This group has social norms, instrumental and affiliative purposes as well as an interdependence of each of the toys to rely on each other. Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology II The competition with Buzz Lightyear and Woody begins almost immediately. First, Buzz Lightyear is placed on the bed and left there. This place on the bed is known by the toys and Woody to be “Woody’s spot”. Buzz at this point does not know he is a toy but indeed a real Space Ranger. The toys are ecstatic to see Buzz Lightyear and are impressed with the detail in which Buzz Lightyear was created. They are impressed with Buzz Lightyear’s speaker box going so far as to compare it with Woody’s pull-string speaker box, mentioning that Buzz’s technology is far more advance. Because of that feature along with the overall excitement of a new toy, Buzz gets the attention from the toys instead of the usual by Woody. The scene continues as Andy’s room changes and more of the setting of Andy’s room is filled with Buzz Lightyear themes. Woody walks around to see that Buzz is adding value to the other toys – he brushes the hair of the pink haired troll, he helps Rex to gain a dinosaur’s voice, and even the Etch-a-Sketch walks around with Buzz’s portrait. It even appears to be that Buzz has organized a fitness program for the toys. The last scene shows that Andy has made the choice to leave Woody in the toy bin and instead chooses to opt to sleep with Buzz Lightyear instead. Woody displays a need for affiliation in Andy. Not only does Woody experience this need for affiliation, but all of the toys in Andy’s room express that need. Social psychology defines need for affiliation as “a motivation that underlies our desire to establish and maintain rewarding interpersonal relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Although Andy himself is not aware of the toys ability to express human emotions like a living creature, the toys very much feel purpose and belonging in being Andy’s toy. The audience is able to see how distraught Woody becomes when Andy’s room slowly changes into a space-based Buzz Lightyear theme. Woody is seen depressingly residing in the toy chest as he attempts to accept the fact that Buzz Lightyear has become Andy’s new favorite toy. Not only does Woody display a need for affiliation, he also expressed a need for intimacy. Bordens and Horowitz describe this need as “a motivation for close and affectionate relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toys express wonder and awe that Buzz’s new features and his ability to solve basic problems that the toys have. For example, Buzz Lightyear shows Rex how to find his “scary” voice. Woody appears to be ignored as the toys fawn over the new toy that is Buzz Lightyear. Both the struggle for the need for intimacy as well as affiliation obviously leads to a very visibly distraught Woody, who spends the night along in the toy chest as Andy falls asleep with Buzz Lightyear in his arms. This sense of frustration at the change of Andy’s affection toward Woody and growth of affection toward Buzz Lightyear as well as Buzz Lightyear seemingly being incapable of understanding that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear can be visibly seen throughout the scenes as Andy plays with Buzz and neglecting Woody. This frustration likely led Woody to confront Buzz Lightyear and to attempt to stop Buzz Lightyear from being taken to Pizza Planet. Social psychology refers to a link between frustration and aggression. This is called the frustration-aggression hypothesis. This hypothesis views that aggression is “always the consequence of frustration . . . the occurrence of aggressive behavior presupposes the existence of frustration and, contrariwise . . . the existence of frustration leads to some form of aggression.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This hypothesis holds three parts. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) First is the strength of the original drive. Woody was used to being Andy’s favorite toy and is shocked at change and inability to influence the direction that Andy is going with his favoritism growing toward Buzz Lightyear. Second is the degree to which the behavior is thwarted. Buzz Lightyear is not actively attempting to become Andy’s favorite toy, since Buzz Lightyear himself does not even believe that he is a toy. This could potentially be more frustrating for Woody than if Buzz Lightyear was actively confronting Woody in an attempt to become Andy’s favorite toy. Finally, the number of frustrated responses. The movie scene with Andy continuously playing with Buzz Lightyear instead of Woody portrays the numerous amounts of times that Woody becomes dismayed at the growing evident truth that Andy no longer considers Woody to be his favorite toy. Therefore, it is very possible to see the connection between the frustration and anger that builds up inside of Woody as a result of the appearance of Buzz Lightyear. Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology III A quarrel between Andy and Woody results in being taken to Sid’s house. We witness Sid’s manipulation of the toys in what appears to be a sick and twisted way. The movie portrays Sid as the antagonist in which the toys fearfully avoid any contact with Sid. While captured in Sid’s room, Woody and Buzz encounter the strange creatures that Sid has manipulated and disfigured. They witness what appears to be the toys fighting over the remains of a toy that Sid had just disfigured. Buzz mentions that they are cannibals and they hide for refuge. After a session of being tortured by Sid, Woody and Buzz notice that the door to Sid’s room is open. As they attempt to make a run for it to escape, they are again approached by the disfigured toys in Sid’s room. And before the toys can manage anything, Woody activates Buzz’s karate chop action to keep the disfigured toys at bay as they escape from the room. While Woody attempts to establish an escape route to Andy’s house, Buzz is swarmed by the so-called cannibal toys. Woody fights his way to the circle and when he reaches the inside of the circle he finds that instead of the toys have repaired Buzz. They are, instead of cannibals, humanistic toys. Not only are they not cannibals, but they are also very shy. We see that the toys, though horribly disfigured, are able to convey empathy because they agree to help Woody save Buzz. Their cooperation is finally seen in full action when the toys act against Sid and coordinate confronting Sid and his abuse of his toys. Woody and Buzz made a judgement about Sid’s toys based on what they saw and felt. This process is called impression formation. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, there are two types of this impression formation according to social psychology. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The first is automatic processing and the second is controlled processing. Automatic processing is known as the idea that we process information without much thought. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This idea runs parallel or in conjunction to the idea of humans being cognitive misers. A cognitive miser is known as “a label suggesting that because humans have a limited capacity to understand information, we only deal with small amounts of social information and prefer the least effortful means of processing it.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Another important understanding to the automatic and controlled processing theory is that both are not separate entities but rather a continuum from ranging from more or less of two sides. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Considering the situation that Woody and Buzz were in – that is, in complete terror of Sid’s house and being in the close proximity of Sid, it is very evident that Woody and Buzz made a judgment of social processing of the disfigured toys owned by Sid. The toys were disfigured and monstrous looking and the first encounter Woody and Buzz has with these creatures is when they witness the appearance of the creatures attempting to fight over the remains of another disfigured toy. Of course, as the movie continues we see that the creatures are not actually cannibals at all and the controlled processing of social judgement is evident in Woody when he attempts to fight off the creatures who appear to be attempting to eat Buzz. Woody sees that Buzz has actually in fact been repaired. The realization that his social processing judgement was not correct is evident in that it takes him a few moments to realize how wrong Woody and Buzz were about the creatures. Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology I Buzz Lightyear is introduced to the audience as the toy that believes he is real, as in he believes the character he was designed to be. Part of the tension that arises from Buzz and Woody results in the error in Buzz’s perception, believing he is truly a real Space Ranger. In the first encounter with Woody and resulting altercation, Buzz jumps off the bed and manages to land an aerial maneuver which the audience knows to be as Woody says, “falling in style”. This error is corrected when, while in the depths of Sid’s house, Buzz sees a television commercial advertising the toy. Buzz walks away from the television in shock. He then sees a window and jumps off the top of the stairs in order to prove to himself that he is the real Buzz Lightyear and that he can indeed fly. He falls to the bottom of the stairs and the camera pans out as we see a broken Buzz Lightyear as his arm has fallen off. We next see Buzz a participant of a tea party, becoming a character known as Ms. Nesbitt. It is obvious to the audience he is delirious or has become drunk from the tea party. He spends a certain amount of time in melancholy as he processes that he is merely a toy. In the final capture scene with Woody and Buzz, Woody manages to convey to Buzz the value inherent in being “Andy’s toy”. Buzz gains understanding of his place in the world and they eventually escape and manage being returned to Andy. Autobiographical memory is known as “memory for information relating to the self that plays a powerful role in recall of events.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Buzz Lightyear has a perception of himself based on memories that do not exist. That is, he believes himself to be the real Buzz Lightyear when he is in fact, a toy. Furthermore, Buzz Lightyear is also a character from a fictional story. So, Buzz Lightyear as we know it in the movie is a toy that believes himself to be a character that is actually a fictional. According to social psychology, Buzz Lightyear takes from his memories in order to form a larger identity of self-perception. This theory is plausible in the circumstance of real human beings but cannot be applied readily to toys with anthropomorphic features. Being that Buzz Lightyear is a toy it cannot be readily explained by social psychology how the personality of Buzz Lightyear was created and why he believes himself to be the Buzz Lightyear, which again is in fact a fictional character. How was he able to emulate the events and personality of the character if we assume that Buzz Lightyear was in his original packaging until he was opened? Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology II A significant hurdle to understanding Toy Story is the dynamic between Andy and the toys that belong to Andy. To the toys Andy plays a significant role and the identity of the toys all revolve around Andy. The significance of the relationship between Andy and the toys can be seen in the mark that Andy leaves on the bottom of Woody and Buzz’s boot. This signifies to the toys that they belong to Andy. There is a great deal of emphasis in Andy shown in the anxiety at the consequent birthday parties in which potential new toys arrive. Andy, though unaware, has significant power over the toys in that he could discard a toy or neglect it and that toy would understand the repercussions of Andy’s actions. This is why the toys display anxiety when Andy’s birthday party comes – they fear being discarded or replaced. Sid is also another figure that conveys large amounts of power over the toys. An important point to mention is that the toys resume a lifeless state when in the presence of a human, with the exception of the confrontation of Sid by the toys that Sid has disfigured, in which the toys are at the mercy of the user. Ostracism is known as “the widespread and universal behavior of excluding or ignoring other individuals or groups”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Bordens and Horowitz explain two types of ostracism: punitive and defensive. Punitive ostracism is used to punish or to deter unwanted behavior and defensive ostracism is used to protect oneself or group from others. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) However, social psychology does not explain the ostracism that occurs when for example, in Toy Story, a toy is replaced by a newer, better toy. There is simply no sort of human behavior that can be explained in this view of social psychology. Andy holds in some ways a sort of God like power over the toys, though he is completely unaware of that power. And in what way is a human being ever replaced by a newer human being and then simply discarded? It is the authors belief, though not explicitly stated, that ostracism exists because humans cannot simply be replaced with a newer more functioning form of the same human being. The individual is instead merely ostracized. Though religion may be able to explain a phenomenon similar to the anxiety the toys feel at being replaced, there simply is no phenomena that occurs in the way that Andy is portrayed as. There can be no doubt that Andy, though he has no idea that his toys can talk, has an incredible amount of influence over the toys. Andy also interacts with them, though when he interacts with the toys it is a lifeless toy he interacts with. However, it appears that they remember and are aware of the events that take place as the humans play with them. In essence, the toys represent a sort of one-sided relationship. Andy does not communicate with them nor does he understand that the toys have feelings for him. It is therefore ostracism that comes closest to the type of dynamic that occurs between the toys when they fear being replaced as a result of Andy’s birthday gifts, but it does not come close to actual human behavior because we are not toys and toys are not capable of thoughts. Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology III Finally, there is the question of Sid. We are introduced to the character very nearly in the beginning, nearly at around the same time that Buzz Lightyear is introduced. We see Sid’s apparent lack of empathy towards the toys, and since the audience views the toys as creatures capable of understanding of complex thoughts as well as pain, we view Sid’s approach to play as torture. Because we view Sid’s actions as torture the audience is able to see Sid’s image as that of a sociopath. Despite the movie’s portrayal of Sid as a sociopath, he displays interesting features that are unlike that of a sociopath. In the final confrontation of Sid by the disfigured toys we see that Sid is capable of experiencing fear. Would Sid have continued to “torture” the toys if he had known they were capable of sentient thought? Socio-interactional model states that “antisocial behavior arises early in life and is the result of poor parenting, leading a child to develop conduct problems that affect peer relations and academic performance.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) When the audience is given a peek into the life of Sid and can take an objective look at the situation in his house, things look fairly decent. That is, Sid’s mother doesn’t appear to be abusive or neglectful and Sid still appears to have a father in the household, albeit a potentially lazy father. Furthermore, apart from bothering his sister, Sid appears to be a normal boy. The audience has the omniscient effect in that they are able to see that the toys can talk and indeed feel pain when they are tortured. However, Sid is unaware of this until the of the movie when Sid’s toys confront him. Despite the many theories of aggression, including the social-modeling theory of aggression by Albert Bandura, which theorizes that “attitude formation learning through watching what people do and whether they are rewarded or punished and then imitating that behavior” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014), Sid appears to be a healthy boy despite the view of the audience that Sid tortures toys. As Sid is torturing Woody with a magnifying glass, he quotes what appears to be a Star Wars quote saying “Where are your rebel friends now?” as he roleplays the role of the interrogator. Does social-psychology account for the boy’s desire to roleplay and explore different roles, even aggressive roles? Social-psychology does account for evolutionary reasons for aggression, but appears to be, to the opinion of the author, incapable of explaining the necessity for people to act out aggressive behaviors in positive ways, let alone boys who are experiencing increases of testosterone. Plausibility There is very little in the way of plausibility of Toy Story at first glance. As far as we know it, toys do not speak nor do they move on their own. However, from a social psychology perspective these toys exhibit many different facets of social psychology. First, the relationship between the toys as they relate to each other, empathize, and even unknowingly engaging in groupthink lends to the plausibility of social psychological concepts. The toys move against Woody when they assume that Woody was attempting to murder Buzz Lightyear despite having a clear lack of evidence against Woody. The toys also engage and interact with each other as a group – they very clearly show the ability to influence each other like for example, when the toys collectively panic when they see that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to the current day. They also show deeper levels of interaction – Woody and Bo Peep express romantic gestures and Woody and Slinky also express a deep sort of relationship. Woody and Buzz even express aggression and competition with each other. However, the author makes note of the insulation of the world in which the toys live in. The humans appear to be oblivious to the lives of the toys and rightly so, as generally it can be assumed that toys do not move and talk autonomously. So, from within the group and perspectives of the toys it can be said that the social psychological plausibility is very high. But once the examination of this plausibility extends further, more outward from the group it can be said that the plausibility is very low. That is, the toys only interact with themselves and of course with the humans, but the humans do not knowingly interact with the toys. In this context are the toys the Gods or fairies which manipulate the lives of humans or do humans play the role of God with the ability to destroy or create the toys and their personalities? Social psychology does not explain this, understandably. Conclusion Toy Story is arguably a story created for children. There is of course, subtle adult humor as in for example, Mr. Potato Head taking his mouth and bumping it against his backside as Slinky attempts to calm the toys in defense of Woody when it is discovered that the birthday party is today. But the story is for children. An important concept of raising children is to teach children empathy. And Toy Story utilizes the concept of using what is commonly seen as an inanimate object to portray those lessons of empathy. There are multiple reasons for this, the author believes. First is the ability to capture the attention of the toys. Children can relate to toys because they interact with toys in imaginative play. The viewing of the toys talking and interacting with each other gives children audience members an opportunity to imagine and to partake in creative play as they watch the movie. Second, being able to take the toys perspective also encourages children to take a look at another’s perspective, or to put one’s self in another’s shoes. This is another exercise in empathy. Third, the movie is able to explore some darker elements of human behavior like for example, aggression, through the use of toys so that the lesson is learned or taught without being explicit with details. In the movie death is only implied but never explicitly said; an example of this being the Bazooka Joe toy that is strapped to the rocket by Sid and is blown up. Another example being Buzz Lightyear falling out of the window as Woody attempted to hide him from Andy. In essence, low level concepts of social psychology can be taught to children with the use of toys bearing anthropomorphic features that exhibit autonomous traits like walking and talking. Of course, the plausibility of the movie from a reality standpoint as well as a psychological standpoint only goes so far as the group elements of the toys, but that cannot be helped since these elements are only explained in simplistic ideas in order to help children grasp larger elements of the need to express empathy in humanity. So, in that view Toy Story is a giant success. References Bordens, K. S., Bordens, K. S., &amp; Horowitz, I. A. (2014). Social psychology. Solon, OH: YOLO Learning Solutions Group." />

Second is the degree to which the behavior is thwarted. Buzz Lightyear is not actively attempting to become Andy’s favorite toy, since Buzz Lightyear himself does not even believe that he is a toy. This could potentially be more frustrating for Woody than if Buzz Lightyear was actively confronting Woody in an attempt to become Andy’s favorite toy. Finally, the number of frustrated responses. The movie scene with Andy continuously playing with Buzz Lightyear instead of Woody portrays the numerous amounts of times that Woody becomes dismayed at the growing evident truth that Andy no longer considers Woody to be his favorite toy. Therefore, it is very possible to see the connection between the frustration and anger that builds up inside of Woody as a result of the appearance of Buzz Lightyear. Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology III A quarrel between Andy and Woody results in being taken to Sid’s house. We witness Sid’s manipulation of the toys in what appears to be a sick and twisted way. The movie portrays Sid as the antagonist in which the toys fearfully avoid any contact with Sid. While captured in Sid’s room, Woody and Buzz encounter the strange creatures that Sid has manipulated and disfigured. They witness what appears to be the toys fighting over the remains of a toy that Sid had just disfigured. Buzz mentions that they are cannibals and they hide for refuge. After a session of being tortured by Sid, Woody and Buzz notice that the door to Sid’s room is open. As they attempt to make a run for it to escape, they are again approached by the disfigured toys in Sid’s room. And before the toys can manage anything, Woody activates Buzz’s karate chop action to keep the disfigured toys at bay as they escape from the room. While Woody attempts to establish an escape route to Andy’s house, Buzz is swarmed by the so-called cannibal toys. Woody fights his way to the circle and when he reaches the inside of the circle he finds that instead of the toys have repaired Buzz. They are, instead of cannibals, humanistic toys. Not only are they not cannibals, but they are also very shy. We see that the toys, though horribly disfigured, are able to convey empathy because they agree to help Woody save Buzz. Their cooperation is finally seen in full action when the toys act against Sid and coordinate confronting Sid and his abuse of his toys. Woody and Buzz made a judgement about Sid’s toys based on what they saw and felt. This process is called impression formation. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, there are two types of this impression formation according to social psychology. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The first is automatic processing and the second is controlled processing. Automatic processing is known as the idea that we process information without much thought. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This idea runs parallel or in conjunction to the idea of humans being cognitive misers. A cognitive miser is known as “a label suggesting that because humans have a limited capacity to understand information, we only deal with small amounts of social information and prefer the least effortful means of processing it.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Another important understanding to the automatic and controlled processing theory is that both are not separate entities but rather a continuum from ranging from more or less of two sides. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Considering the situation that Woody and Buzz were in – that is, in complete terror of Sid’s house and being in the close proximity of Sid, it is very evident that Woody and Buzz made a judgment of social processing of the disfigured toys owned by Sid. The toys were disfigured and monstrous looking and the first encounter Woody and Buzz has with these creatures is when they witness the appearance of the creatures attempting to fight over the remains of another disfigured toy. Of course, as the movie continues we see that the creatures are not actually cannibals at all and the controlled processing of social judgement is evident in Woody when he attempts to fight off the creatures who appear to be attempting to eat Buzz. Woody sees that Buzz has actually in fact been repaired. The realization that his social processing judgement was not correct is evident in that it takes him a few moments to realize how wrong Woody and Buzz were about the creatures. Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology I Buzz Lightyear is introduced to the audience as the toy that believes he is real, as in he believes the character he was designed to be. Part of the tension that arises from Buzz and Woody results in the error in Buzz’s perception, believing he is truly a real Space Ranger. In the first encounter with Woody and resulting altercation, Buzz jumps off the bed and manages to land an aerial maneuver which the audience knows to be as Woody says, “falling in style”. This error is corrected when, while in the depths of Sid’s house, Buzz sees a television commercial advertising the toy. Buzz walks away from the television in shock. He then sees a window and jumps off the top of the stairs in order to prove to himself that he is the real Buzz Lightyear and that he can indeed fly. He falls to the bottom of the stairs and the camera pans out as we see a broken Buzz Lightyear as his arm has fallen off. We next see Buzz a participant of a tea party, becoming a character known as Ms. Nesbitt. It is obvious to the audience he is delirious or has become drunk from the tea party. He spends a certain amount of time in melancholy as he processes that he is merely a toy. In the final capture scene with Woody and Buzz, Woody manages to convey to Buzz the value inherent in being “Andy’s toy”. Buzz gains understanding of his place in the world and they eventually escape and manage being returned to Andy. Autobiographical memory is known as “memory for information relating to the self that plays a powerful role in recall of events.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Buzz Lightyear has a perception of himself based on memories that do not exist. That is, he believes himself to be the real Buzz Lightyear when he is in fact, a toy. Furthermore, Buzz Lightyear is also a character from a fictional story. So, Buzz Lightyear as we know it in the movie is a toy that believes himself to be a character that is actually a fictional. According to social psychology, Buzz Lightyear takes from his memories in order to form a larger identity of self-perception. This theory is plausible in the circumstance of real human beings but cannot be applied readily to toys with anthropomorphic features. Being that Buzz Lightyear is a toy it cannot be readily explained by social psychology how the personality of Buzz Lightyear was created and why he believes himself to be the Buzz Lightyear, which again is in fact a fictional character. How was he able to emulate the events and personality of the character if we assume that Buzz Lightyear was in his original packaging until he was opened? Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology II A significant hurdle to understanding Toy Story is the dynamic between Andy and the toys that belong to Andy. To the toys Andy plays a significant role and the identity of the toys all revolve around Andy. The significance of the relationship between Andy and the toys can be seen in the mark that Andy leaves on the bottom of Woody and Buzz’s boot. This signifies to the toys that they belong to Andy. There is a great deal of emphasis in Andy shown in the anxiety at the consequent birthday parties in which potential new toys arrive. Andy, though unaware, has significant power over the toys in that he could discard a toy or neglect it and that toy would understand the repercussions of Andy’s actions. This is why the toys display anxiety when Andy’s birthday party comes – they fear being discarded or replaced. Sid is also another figure that conveys large amounts of power over the toys. An important point to mention is that the toys resume a lifeless state when in the presence of a human, with the exception of the confrontation of Sid by the toys that Sid has disfigured, in which the toys are at the mercy of the user. Ostracism is known as “the widespread and universal behavior of excluding or ignoring other individuals or groups”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Bordens and Horowitz explain two types of ostracism: punitive and defensive. Punitive ostracism is used to punish or to deter unwanted behavior and defensive ostracism is used to protect oneself or group from others. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) However, social psychology does not explain the ostracism that occurs when for example, in Toy Story, a toy is replaced by a newer, better toy. There is simply no sort of human behavior that can be explained in this view of social psychology. Andy holds in some ways a sort of God like power over the toys, though he is completely unaware of that power. And in what way is a human being ever replaced by a newer human being and then simply discarded? It is the authors belief, though not explicitly stated, that ostracism exists because humans cannot simply be replaced with a newer more functioning form of the same human being. The individual is instead merely ostracized. Though religion may be able to explain a phenomenon similar to the anxiety the toys feel at being replaced, there simply is no phenomena that occurs in the way that Andy is portrayed as. There can be no doubt that Andy, though he has no idea that his toys can talk, has an incredible amount of influence over the toys. Andy also interacts with them, though when he interacts with the toys it is a lifeless toy he interacts with. However, it appears that they remember and are aware of the events that take place as the humans play with them. In essence, the toys represent a sort of one-sided relationship. Andy does not communicate with them nor does he understand that the toys have feelings for him. It is therefore ostracism that comes closest to the type of dynamic that occurs between the toys when they fear being replaced as a result of Andy’s birthday gifts, but it does not come close to actual human behavior because we are not toys and toys are not capable of thoughts. Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology III Finally, there is the question of Sid. We are introduced to the character very nearly in the beginning, nearly at around the same time that Buzz Lightyear is introduced. We see Sid’s apparent lack of empathy towards the toys, and since the audience views the toys as creatures capable of understanding of complex thoughts as well as pain, we view Sid’s approach to play as torture. Because we view Sid’s actions as torture the audience is able to see Sid’s image as that of a sociopath. Despite the movie’s portrayal of Sid as a sociopath, he displays interesting features that are unlike that of a sociopath. In the final confrontation of Sid by the disfigured toys we see that Sid is capable of experiencing fear. Would Sid have continued to “torture” the toys if he had known they were capable of sentient thought? Socio-interactional model states that “antisocial behavior arises early in life and is the result of poor parenting, leading a child to develop conduct problems that affect peer relations and academic performance.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) When the audience is given a peek into the life of Sid and can take an objective look at the situation in his house, things look fairly decent. That is, Sid’s mother doesn’t appear to be abusive or neglectful and Sid still appears to have a father in the household, albeit a potentially lazy father. Furthermore, apart from bothering his sister, Sid appears to be a normal boy. The audience has the omniscient effect in that they are able to see that the toys can talk and indeed feel pain when they are tortured. However, Sid is unaware of this until the of the movie when Sid’s toys confront him. Despite the many theories of aggression, including the social-modeling theory of aggression by Albert Bandura, which theorizes that “attitude formation learning through watching what people do and whether they are rewarded or punished and then imitating that behavior” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014), Sid appears to be a healthy boy despite the view of the audience that Sid tortures toys. As Sid is torturing Woody with a magnifying glass, he quotes what appears to be a Star Wars quote saying “Where are your rebel friends now?” as he roleplays the role of the interrogator. Does social-psychology account for the boy’s desire to roleplay and explore different roles, even aggressive roles? Social-psychology does account for evolutionary reasons for aggression, but appears to be, to the opinion of the author, incapable of explaining the necessity for people to act out aggressive behaviors in positive ways, let alone boys who are experiencing increases of testosterone. Plausibility There is very little in the way of plausibility of Toy Story at first glance. As far as we know it, toys do not speak nor do they move on their own. However, from a social psychology perspective these toys exhibit many different facets of social psychology. First, the relationship between the toys as they relate to each other, empathize, and even unknowingly engaging in groupthink lends to the plausibility of social psychological concepts. The toys move against Woody when they assume that Woody was attempting to murder Buzz Lightyear despite having a clear lack of evidence against Woody. The toys also engage and interact with each other as a group – they very clearly show the ability to influence each other like for example, when the toys collectively panic when they see that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to the current day. They also show deeper levels of interaction – Woody and Bo Peep express romantic gestures and Woody and Slinky also express a deep sort of relationship. Woody and Buzz even express aggression and competition with each other. However, the author makes note of the insulation of the world in which the toys live in. The humans appear to be oblivious to the lives of the toys and rightly so, as generally it can be assumed that toys do not move and talk autonomously. So, from within the group and perspectives of the toys it can be said that the social psychological plausibility is very high. But once the examination of this plausibility extends further, more outward from the group it can be said that the plausibility is very low. That is, the toys only interact with themselves and of course with the humans, but the humans do not knowingly interact with the toys. In this context are the toys the Gods or fairies which manipulate the lives of humans or do humans play the role of God with the ability to destroy or create the toys and their personalities? Social psychology does not explain this, understandably. Conclusion Toy Story is arguably a story created for children. There is of course, subtle adult humor as in for example, Mr. Potato Head taking his mouth and bumping it against his backside as Slinky attempts to calm the toys in defense of Woody when it is discovered that the birthday party is today. But the story is for children. An important concept of raising children is to teach children empathy. And Toy Story utilizes the concept of using what is commonly seen as an inanimate object to portray those lessons of empathy. There are multiple reasons for this, the author believes. First is the ability to capture the attention of the toys. Children can relate to toys because they interact with toys in imaginative play. The viewing of the toys talking and interacting with each other gives children audience members an opportunity to imagine and to partake in creative play as they watch the movie. Second, being able to take the toys perspective also encourages children to take a look at another’s perspective, or to put one’s self in another’s shoes. This is another exercise in empathy. Third, the movie is able to explore some darker elements of human behavior like for example, aggression, through the use of toys so that the lesson is learned or taught without being explicit with details. In the movie death is only implied but never explicitly said; an example of this being the Bazooka Joe toy that is strapped to the rocket by Sid and is blown up. Another example being Buzz Lightyear falling out of the window as Woody attempted to hide him from Andy. In essence, low level concepts of social psychology can be taught to children with the use of toys bearing anthropomorphic features that exhibit autonomous traits like walking and talking. Of course, the plausibility of the movie from a reality standpoint as well as a psychological standpoint only goes so far as the group elements of the toys, but that cannot be helped since these elements are only explained in simplistic ideas in order to help children grasp larger elements of the need to express empathy in humanity. So, in that view Toy Story is a giant success. References Bordens, K. S., Bordens, K. S., &amp; Horowitz, I. A. (2014). Social psychology. Solon, OH: YOLO Learning Solutions Group." />

Many of them appear to enjoy their roles as toys. And there is obviously a sense or understanding of inevitable favoritism by Andy. For Andy, Woody was Andy’s favorite toy for some time. Generally, there is not much in the room of anxiety or conflict until Andy’s birthday party arrives, in which the toys greatly fear that they will be replaced by a new toy. Woody tries to calm the toys but the toys still relent with anxiety. Mr. Potato Head goes so far as to say “Of course Woody ain’t worried! He’s been Andy’s favorite since kindergarten!” It also appears to be that the toys view Woody as the toy that leads and directs, mostly exhibited by the ability of Woody to gain the compliance of the toy soldiers. The toys in their anxiety send out the soldier toys in order to spy on the events that transpire during the party that they might be able to see what arrives in the presents that the party attendees gift to Andy. The gifts received are irrelevant to the toys in that the gifts are toys that do not seem to exhibit any ability to be autonomous, i.e., a lunch box and a Battle Ships board game. Finally, when all looks clear for the toys, Andy’s mother pulls out a surprise gift, which is a new toy. The toys that collectively call themselves “Andy’s toys” are what social psychology calls a group. A group is “an aggregate of individuals who interact with and influence one another.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, Bordens and Horowitz use the example of a bus stop and the number of people that wait at that bus stop. These people are not a group because they are not “truly influencing each other” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) and they only interact with each other “on a basic level”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Andy’s toys appear to spend a great deal of time together. In fact, these toys individually refer to themselves as Andy’s toys. These toys appear to play together when Andy is not around – Woody is asked to play checkers by Slinky and Buzz Lightyear brushes the hair of the pink troll. The amount of influence they have on each other is conveyed with Woody announces to the other toys that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to today. The toys collectively influence each other in that they all begin an outbreak of anxiety and fear that they will be replaced by a newer toy. Social psychology refers to two types of groups. One is an instrumental group and another is an affiliate group. I propose that both groups have relevancy in Toy Story concerning Andy’s toys. An instrumental group is referred to as groups that exist to “perform some task or reach some specific goal.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) With the exception of Buzz Lightyear, the toys have an understanding that they are indeed toys and that they serve Andy as his toys. An affiliate group is known as a group that exists on a more general level and often for social means. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Though the toys had no choice in the matter of becoming Andy’s toy, they take joy in this and also socialize with each other whenever Andy is not at home. There are also group norms associated with Andy’s toys. Group norms are defined as “expectations concerning the kinds of behaviors required of group members”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) On one level they appear to exhibit a basic understanding of morality. Death is not explicitly implied in this movie, however the toys become upset when they assume Woody to be responsible for Buzz falling out of the window. There is another scene where Woody is trying to convince the toys that they ought to assist Woody and Buzz with escaping Sid’s house – Woody uses Buzz’s arm to appear to convey that Buzz is fine. When the toys see through the illusion, Rex the dinosaur appears to gag at the thought of Woody carrying around Buzz’s arm. Furthermore, before the appearance of Buzz Lightyear, it was generally assumed that Woody was Andy’s favorite toy. It appears to be that because Woody is Andy’s favorite toy that he takes a commanding role over the other toys. Furthermore, the toys seem to have their own spot in Andy’s room – Woody’s spot was on Andy’s bed. There also appears to be interdependency between the toys. That is, they need each other. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toy soldiers work together in conjunction with the other toys to spy on the birthday party. Each of the toys seek out moving partner in order to prevent being lost in the moving process. These points clearly indicate in a social psychological perspective that Andy’s toys are collectively a group. This group has social norms, instrumental and affiliative purposes as well as an interdependence of each of the toys to rely on each other. Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology II The competition with Buzz Lightyear and Woody begins almost immediately. First, Buzz Lightyear is placed on the bed and left there. This place on the bed is known by the toys and Woody to be “Woody’s spot”. Buzz at this point does not know he is a toy but indeed a real Space Ranger. The toys are ecstatic to see Buzz Lightyear and are impressed with the detail in which Buzz Lightyear was created. They are impressed with Buzz Lightyear’s speaker box going so far as to compare it with Woody’s pull-string speaker box, mentioning that Buzz’s technology is far more advance. Because of that feature along with the overall excitement of a new toy, Buzz gets the attention from the toys instead of the usual by Woody. The scene continues as Andy’s room changes and more of the setting of Andy’s room is filled with Buzz Lightyear themes. Woody walks around to see that Buzz is adding value to the other toys – he brushes the hair of the pink haired troll, he helps Rex to gain a dinosaur’s voice, and even the Etch-a-Sketch walks around with Buzz’s portrait. It even appears to be that Buzz has organized a fitness program for the toys. The last scene shows that Andy has made the choice to leave Woody in the toy bin and instead chooses to opt to sleep with Buzz Lightyear instead. Woody displays a need for affiliation in Andy. Not only does Woody experience this need for affiliation, but all of the toys in Andy’s room express that need. Social psychology defines need for affiliation as “a motivation that underlies our desire to establish and maintain rewarding interpersonal relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Although Andy himself is not aware of the toys ability to express human emotions like a living creature, the toys very much feel purpose and belonging in being Andy’s toy. The audience is able to see how distraught Woody becomes when Andy’s room slowly changes into a space-based Buzz Lightyear theme. Woody is seen depressingly residing in the toy chest as he attempts to accept the fact that Buzz Lightyear has become Andy’s new favorite toy. Not only does Woody display a need for affiliation, he also expressed a need for intimacy. Bordens and Horowitz describe this need as “a motivation for close and affectionate relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toys express wonder and awe that Buzz’s new features and his ability to solve basic problems that the toys have. For example, Buzz Lightyear shows Rex how to find his “scary” voice. Woody appears to be ignored as the toys fawn over the new toy that is Buzz Lightyear. Both the struggle for the need for intimacy as well as affiliation obviously leads to a very visibly distraught Woody, who spends the night along in the toy chest as Andy falls asleep with Buzz Lightyear in his arms. This sense of frustration at the change of Andy’s affection toward Woody and growth of affection toward Buzz Lightyear as well as Buzz Lightyear seemingly being incapable of understanding that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear can be visibly seen throughout the scenes as Andy plays with Buzz and neglecting Woody. This frustration likely led Woody to confront Buzz Lightyear and to attempt to stop Buzz Lightyear from being taken to Pizza Planet. Social psychology refers to a link between frustration and aggression. This is called the frustration-aggression hypothesis. This hypothesis views that aggression is “always the consequence of frustration . . . the occurrence of aggressive behavior presupposes the existence of frustration and, contrariwise . . . the existence of frustration leads to some form of aggression.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This hypothesis holds three parts. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) First is the strength of the original drive. Woody was used to being Andy’s favorite toy and is shocked at change and inability to influence the direction that Andy is going with his favoritism growing toward Buzz Lightyear. Second is the degree to which the behavior is thwarted. Buzz Lightyear is not actively attempting to become Andy’s favorite toy, since Buzz Lightyear himself does not even believe that he is a toy. This could potentially be more frustrating for Woody than if Buzz Lightyear was actively confronting Woody in an attempt to become Andy’s favorite toy. Finally, the number of frustrated responses. The movie scene with Andy continuously playing with Buzz Lightyear instead of Woody portrays the numerous amounts of times that Woody becomes dismayed at the growing evident truth that Andy no longer considers Woody to be his favorite toy. Therefore, it is very possible to see the connection between the frustration and anger that builds up inside of Woody as a result of the appearance of Buzz Lightyear.

To the toys Andy plays a significant role and the identity of the toys all revolve around Andy. The significance of the relationship between Andy and the toys can be seen in the mark that Andy leaves on the bottom of Woody and Buzz’s boot. This signifies to the toys that they belong to Andy.

The individual is instead merely ostracized. Though religion may be able to explain a phenomenon similar to the anxiety the toys feel at being replaced, there simply is no phenomena that occurs in the way that Andy is portrayed as. There can be no doubt that Andy, though he has no idea that his toys can talk, has an incredible amount of influence over the toys. Andy also interacts with them, though when he interacts with the toys it is a lifeless toy he interacts with. However, it appears that they remember and are aware of the events that take place as the humans play with them. In essence, the toys represent a sort of one-sided relationship. Andy does not communicate with them nor does he understand that the toys have feelings for him. It is therefore ostracism that comes closest to the type of dynamic that occurs between the toys when they fear being replaced as a result of Andy’s birthday gifts, but it does not come close to actual human behavior because we are not toys and toys are not capable of thoughts. Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology III Finally, there is the question of Sid. We are introduced to the character very nearly in the beginning, nearly at around the same time that Buzz Lightyear is introduced. We see Sid’s apparent lack of empathy towards the toys, and since the audience views the toys as creatures capable of understanding of complex thoughts as well as pain, we view Sid’s approach to play as torture. Because we view Sid’s actions as torture the audience is able to see Sid’s image as that of a sociopath. Despite the movie’s portrayal of Sid as a sociopath, he displays interesting features that are unlike that of a sociopath. In the final confrontation of Sid by the disfigured toys we see that Sid is capable of experiencing fear. Would Sid have continued to “torture” the toys if he had known they were capable of sentient thought? Socio-interactional model states that “antisocial behavior arises early in life and is the result of poor parenting, leading a child to develop conduct problems that affect peer relations and academic performance.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) When the audience is given a peek into the life of Sid and can take an objective look at the situation in his house, things look fairly decent. That is, Sid’s mother doesn’t appear to be abusive or neglectful and Sid still appears to have a father in the household, albeit a potentially lazy father. Furthermore, apart from bothering his sister, Sid appears to be a normal boy. The audience has the omniscient effect in that they are able to see that the toys can talk and indeed feel pain when they are tortured. However, Sid is unaware of this until the of the movie when Sid’s toys confront him. Despite the many theories of aggression, including the social-modeling theory of aggression by Albert Bandura, which theorizes that “attitude formation learning through watching what people do and whether they are rewarded or punished and then imitating that behavior” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014), Sid appears to be a healthy boy despite the view of the audience that Sid tortures toys. As Sid is torturing Woody with a magnifying glass, he quotes what appears to be a Star Wars quote saying “Where are your rebel friends now?” as he roleplays the role of the interrogator. Does social-psychology account for the boy’s desire to roleplay and explore different roles, even aggressive roles? Social-psychology does account for evolutionary reasons for aggression, but appears to be, to the opinion of the author, incapable of explaining the necessity for people to act out aggressive behaviors in positive ways, let alone boys who are experiencing increases of testosterone. Plausibility There is very little in the way of plausibility of Toy Story at first glance. As far as we know it, toys do not speak nor do they move on their own. However, from a social psychology perspective these toys exhibit many different facets of social psychology. First, the relationship between the toys as they relate to each other, empathize, and even unknowingly engaging in groupthink lends to the plausibility of social psychological concepts. The toys move against Woody when they assume that Woody was attempting to murder Buzz Lightyear despite having a clear lack of evidence against Woody. The toys also engage and interact with each other as a group – they very clearly show the ability to influence each other like for example, when the toys collectively panic when they see that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to the current day. They also show deeper levels of interaction – Woody and Bo Peep express romantic gestures and Woody and Slinky also express a deep sort of relationship. Woody and Buzz even express aggression and competition with each other. However, the author makes note of the insulation of the world in which the toys live in. The humans appear to be oblivious to the lives of the toys and rightly so, as generally it can be assumed that toys do not move and talk autonomously. So, from within the group and perspectives of the toys it can be said that the social psychological plausibility is very high. But once the examination of this plausibility extends further, more outward from the group it can be said that the plausibility is very low. That is, the toys only interact with themselves and of course with the humans, but the humans do not knowingly interact with the toys. In this context are the toys the Gods or fairies which manipulate the lives of humans or do humans play the role of God with the ability to destroy or create the toys and their personalities? Social psychology does not explain this, understandably. Conclusion Toy Story is arguably a story created for children. There is of course, subtle adult humor as in for example, Mr. Potato Head taking his mouth and bumping it against his backside as Slinky attempts to calm the toys in defense of Woody when it is discovered that the birthday party is today. But the story is for children. An important concept of raising children is to teach children empathy. And Toy Story utilizes the concept of using what is commonly seen as an inanimate object to portray those lessons of empathy. There are multiple reasons for this, the author believes. First is the ability to capture the attention of the toys. Children can relate to toys because they interact with toys in imaginative play. The viewing of the toys talking and interacting with each other gives children audience members an opportunity to imagine and to partake in creative play as they watch the movie. Second, being able to take the toys perspective also encourages children to take a look at another’s perspective, or to put one’s self in another’s shoes. This is another exercise in empathy. Third, the movie is able to explore some darker elements of human behavior like for example, aggression, through the use of toys so that the lesson is learned or taught without being explicit with details. In the movie death is only implied but never explicitly said; an example of this being the Bazooka Joe toy that is strapped to the rocket by Sid and is blown up. Another example being Buzz Lightyear falling out of the window as Woody attempted to hide him from Andy. In essence, low level concepts of social psychology can be taught to children with the use of toys bearing anthropomorphic features that exhibit autonomous traits like walking and talking. Of course, the plausibility of the movie from a reality standpoint as well as a psychological standpoint only goes so far as the group elements of the toys, but that cannot be helped since these elements are only explained in simplistic ideas in order to help children grasp larger elements of the need to express empathy in humanity. So, in that view Toy Story is a giant success. References Bordens, K. S., Bordens, K. S., &amp; Horowitz, I. A. (2014). Social psychology.

  <p>Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology I<br />
Andy is the owner of the many toys that appear to “live” in Andy’s room. Many of them appear to enjoy their roles as toys. And there is obviously a sense or understanding of inevitable favoritism by Andy. For Andy, Woody was Andy’s favorite toy for some time. Generally, there is not much in the room of anxiety or conflict until Andy’s birthday party arrives, in which the toys greatly fear that they will be replaced by a new toy. Woody tries to calm the toys but the toys still relent with anxiety. Mr. Potato Head goes so far as to say “Of course Woody ain’t worried! He’s been Andy’s favorite since kindergarten!” It also appears to be that the toys view Woody as the toy that leads and directs, mostly exhibited by the ability of Woody to gain the compliance of the toy soldiers. The toys in their anxiety send out the soldier toys in order to spy on the events that transpire during the party that they might be able to see what arrives in the presents that the party attendees gift to Andy. The gifts received are irrelevant to the toys in that the gifts are toys that do not seem to exhibit any ability to be autonomous, i.e., a lunch box and a Battle Ships board game. Finally, when all looks clear for the toys, Andy’s mother pulls out a surprise gift, which is a new toy.<br />
The toys that collectively call themselves “Andy’s toys” are what social psychology calls a group. A group is “an aggregate of individuals who interact with and influence one another.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, Bordens and Horowitz use the example of a bus stop and the number of people that wait at that bus stop. These people are not a group because they are not “truly influencing each other” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) and they only interact with each other “on a basic level”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Andy’s toys appear to spend a great deal of time together. In fact, these toys individually refer to themselves as Andy’s toys. These toys appear to play together when Andy is not around – Woody is asked to play checkers by Slinky and Buzz Lightyear brushes the hair of the pink troll. The amount of influence they have on each other is conveyed with Woody announces to the other toys that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to today. The toys collectively influence each other in that they all begin an outbreak of anxiety and fear that they will be replaced by a newer toy. Social psychology refers to two types of groups. One is an instrumental group and another is an affiliate group. I propose that both groups have relevancy in Toy Story concerning Andy’s toys. An instrumental group is referred to as groups that exist to “perform some task or reach some specific goal.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) With the exception of Buzz Lightyear, the toys have an understanding that they are indeed toys and that they serve Andy as his toys. An affiliate group is known as a group that exists on a more general level and often for social means. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Though the toys had no choice in the matter of becoming Andy’s toy, they take joy in this and also socialize with each other whenever Andy is not at home.<br />
There are also group norms associated with Andy’s toys. Group norms are defined as “expectations concerning the kinds of behaviors required of group members”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) On one level they appear to exhibit a basic understanding of morality. Death is not explicitly implied in this movie, however the toys become upset when they assume Woody to be responsible for Buzz falling out of the window. There is another scene where Woody is trying to convince the toys that they ought to assist Woody and Buzz with escaping Sid’s house – Woody uses Buzz’s arm to appear to convey that Buzz is fine. When the toys see through the illusion, Rex the dinosaur appears to gag at the thought of Woody carrying around Buzz’s arm. Furthermore, before the appearance of Buzz Lightyear, it was generally assumed that Woody was Andy’s favorite toy. It appears to be that because Woody is Andy’s favorite toy that he takes a commanding role over the other toys. Furthermore, the toys seem to have their own spot in Andy’s room – Woody’s spot was on Andy’s bed. There also appears to be interdependency between the toys. That is, they need each other. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toy soldiers work together in conjunction with the other toys to spy on the birthday party. Each of the toys seek out moving partner in order to prevent being lost in the moving process. These points clearly indicate in a social psychological perspective that Andy’s toys are collectively a group. This group has social norms, instrumental and affiliative purposes as well as an interdependence of each of the toys to rely on each other.<br />
Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology II<br />
The competition with Buzz Lightyear and Woody begins almost immediately. First, Buzz Lightyear is placed on the bed and left there. This place on the bed is known by the toys and Woody to be “Woody’s spot”. Buzz at this point does not know he is a toy but indeed a real Space Ranger. The toys are ecstatic to see Buzz Lightyear and are impressed with the detail in which Buzz Lightyear was created. They are impressed with Buzz Lightyear’s speaker box going so far as to compare it with Woody’s pull-string speaker box, mentioning that Buzz’s technology is far more advance. Because of that feature along with the overall excitement of a new toy, Buzz gets the attention from the toys instead of the usual by Woody. The scene continues as Andy’s room changes and more of the setting of Andy’s room is filled with Buzz Lightyear themes. Woody walks around to see that Buzz is adding value to the other toys – he brushes the hair of the pink haired troll, he helps Rex to gain a dinosaur’s voice, and even the Etch-a-Sketch walks around with Buzz’s portrait. It even appears to be that Buzz has organized a fitness program for the toys. The last scene shows that Andy has made the choice to leave Woody in the toy bin and instead chooses to opt to sleep with Buzz Lightyear instead.<br />
Woody displays a need for affiliation in Andy. Not only does Woody experience this need for affiliation, but all of the toys in Andy’s room express that need. Social psychology defines need for affiliation as “a motivation that underlies our desire to establish and maintain rewarding interpersonal relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Although Andy himself is not aware of the toys ability to express human emotions like a living creature, the toys very much feel purpose and belonging in being Andy’s toy. The audience is able to see how distraught Woody becomes when Andy’s room slowly changes into a space-based Buzz Lightyear theme. Woody is seen depressingly residing in the toy chest as he attempts to accept the fact that Buzz Lightyear has become Andy’s new favorite toy. Not only does Woody display a need for affiliation, he also expressed a need for intimacy. Bordens and Horowitz describe this need as “a motivation for close and affectionate relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toys express wonder and awe that Buzz’s new features and his ability to solve basic problems that the toys have. For example, Buzz Lightyear shows Rex how to find his “scary” voice. Woody appears to be ignored as the toys fawn over the new toy that is Buzz Lightyear. Both the struggle for the need for intimacy as well as affiliation obviously leads to a very visibly distraught Woody, who spends the night along in the toy chest as Andy falls asleep with Buzz Lightyear in his arms.<br />
This sense of frustration at the change of Andy’s affection toward Woody and growth of affection toward Buzz Lightyear as well as Buzz Lightyear seemingly being incapable of understanding that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear can be visibly seen throughout the scenes as Andy plays with Buzz and neglecting Woody. This frustration likely led Woody to confront Buzz Lightyear and to attempt to stop Buzz Lightyear from being taken to Pizza Planet. Social psychology refers to a link between frustration and aggression. This is called the frustration-aggression hypothesis. This hypothesis views that aggression is “always the consequence of frustration . . . the occurrence of aggressive behavior presupposes the existence of frustration and, contrariwise . . . the existence of frustration leads to some form of aggression.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This hypothesis holds three parts. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) First is the strength of the original drive. Woody was used to being Andy’s favorite toy and is shocked at change and inability to influence the direction that Andy is going with his favoritism growing toward Buzz Lightyear. Second is the degree to which the behavior is thwarted. Buzz Lightyear is not actively attempting to become Andy’s favorite toy, since Buzz Lightyear himself does not even believe that he is a toy. This could potentially be more frustrating for Woody than if Buzz Lightyear was actively confronting Woody in an attempt to become Andy’s favorite toy. Finally, the number of frustrated responses. The movie scene with Andy continuously playing with Buzz Lightyear instead of Woody portrays the numerous amounts of times that Woody becomes dismayed at the growing evident truth that Andy no longer considers Woody to be his favorite toy. Therefore, it is very possible to see the connection between the frustration and anger that builds up inside of Woody as a result of the appearance of Buzz Lightyear.<br />
Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology III<br />
A quarrel between Andy and Woody results in being taken to Sid’s house. We witness Sid’s manipulation of the toys in what appears to be a sick and twisted way. The movie portrays Sid as the antagonist in which the toys fearfully avoid any contact with Sid. While captured in Sid’s room, Woody and Buzz encounter the strange creatures that Sid has manipulated and disfigured. They witness what appears to be the toys fighting over the remains of a toy that Sid had just disfigured. Buzz mentions that they are cannibals and they hide for refuge. After a session of being tortured by Sid, Woody and Buzz notice that the door to Sid’s room is open. As they attempt to make a run for it to escape, they are again approached by the disfigured toys in Sid’s room. And before the toys can manage anything, Woody activates Buzz’s karate chop action to keep the disfigured toys at bay as they escape from the room. While Woody attempts to establish an escape route to Andy’s house, Buzz is swarmed by the so-called cannibal toys. Woody fights his way to the circle and when he reaches the inside of the circle he finds that instead of the toys have repaired Buzz. They are, instead of cannibals, humanistic toys. Not only are they not cannibals, but they are also very shy. We see that the toys, though horribly disfigured, are able to convey empathy because they agree to help Woody save Buzz. Their cooperation is finally seen in full action when the toys act against Sid and coordinate confronting Sid and his abuse of his toys.<br />
Woody and Buzz made a judgement about Sid’s toys based on what they saw and felt. This process is called impression formation. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, there are two types of this impression formation according to social psychology. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) The first is automatic processing and the second is controlled processing. Automatic processing is known as the idea that we process information without much thought. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) This idea runs parallel or in conjunction to the idea of humans being cognitive misers. A cognitive miser is known as “a label suggesting that because humans have a limited capacity to understand information, we only deal with small amounts of social information and prefer the least effortful means of processing it.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Another important understanding to the automatic and controlled processing theory is that both are not separate entities but rather a continuum from ranging from more or less of two sides. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Considering the situation that Woody and Buzz were in – that is, in complete terror of Sid’s house and being in the close proximity of Sid, it is very evident that Woody and Buzz made a judgment of social processing of the disfigured toys owned by Sid. The toys were disfigured and monstrous looking and the first encounter Woody and Buzz has with these creatures is when they witness the appearance of the creatures attempting to fight over the remains of another disfigured toy. Of course, as the movie continues we see that the creatures are not actually cannibals at all and the controlled processing of social judgement is evident in Woody when he attempts to fight off the creatures who appear to be attempting to eat Buzz. Woody sees that Buzz has actually in fact been repaired. The realization that his social processing judgement was not correct is evident in that it takes him a few moments to realize how wrong Woody and Buzz were about the creatures.<br />
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology I<br />
Buzz Lightyear is introduced to the audience as the toy that believes he is real, as in he believes the character he was designed to be. Part of the tension that arises from Buzz and Woody results in the error in Buzz’s perception, believing he is truly a real Space Ranger. In the first encounter with Woody and resulting altercation, Buzz jumps off the bed and manages to land an aerial maneuver which the audience knows to be as Woody says, “falling in style”. This error is corrected when, while in the depths of Sid’s house, Buzz sees a television commercial advertising the toy. Buzz walks away from the television in shock. He then sees a window and jumps off the top of the stairs in order to prove to himself that he is the real Buzz Lightyear and that he can indeed fly. He falls to the bottom of the stairs and the camera pans out as we see a broken Buzz Lightyear as his arm has fallen off. We next see Buzz a participant of a tea party, becoming a character known as Ms. Nesbitt. It is obvious to the audience he is delirious or has become drunk from the tea party. He spends a certain amount of time in melancholy as he processes that he is merely a toy. In the final capture scene with Woody and Buzz, Woody manages to convey to Buzz the value inherent in being “Andy’s toy”. Buzz gains understanding of his place in the world and they eventually escape and manage being returned to Andy.<br />
Autobiographical memory is known as “memory for information relating to the self that plays a powerful role in recall of events.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Buzz Lightyear has a perception of himself based on memories that do not exist. That is, he believes himself to be the real Buzz Lightyear when he is in fact, a toy. Furthermore, Buzz Lightyear is also a character from a fictional story. So, Buzz Lightyear as we know it in the movie is a toy that believes himself to be a character that is actually a fictional. According to social psychology, Buzz Lightyear takes from his memories in order to form a larger identity of self-perception. This theory is plausible in the circumstance of real human beings but cannot be applied readily to toys with anthropomorphic features. Being that Buzz Lightyear is a toy it cannot be readily explained by social psychology how the personality of Buzz Lightyear was created and why he believes himself to be the Buzz Lightyear, which again is in fact a fictional character. How was he able to emulate the events and personality of the character if we assume that Buzz Lightyear was in his original packaging until he was opened?<br />
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology II<br />
A significant hurdle to understanding Toy Story is the dynamic between Andy and the toys that belong to Andy. To the toys Andy plays a significant role and the identity of the toys all revolve around Andy. The significance of the relationship between Andy and the toys can be seen in the mark that Andy leaves on the bottom of Woody and Buzz’s boot. This signifies to the toys that they belong to Andy. There is a great deal of emphasis in Andy shown in the anxiety at the consequent birthday parties in which potential new toys arrive. Andy, though unaware, has significant power over the toys in that he could discard a toy or neglect it and that toy would understand the repercussions of Andy’s actions. This is why the toys display anxiety when Andy’s birthday party comes – they fear being discarded or replaced. Sid is also another figure that conveys large amounts of power over the toys. An important point to mention is that the toys resume a lifeless state when in the presence of a human, with the exception of the confrontation of Sid by the toys that Sid has disfigured, in which the toys are at the mercy of the user.<br />
Ostracism is known as “the widespread and universal behavior of excluding or ignoring other individuals or groups”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) Bordens and Horowitz explain two types of ostracism: punitive and defensive. Punitive ostracism is used to punish or to deter unwanted behavior and defensive ostracism is used to protect oneself or group from others. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) However, social psychology does not explain the ostracism that occurs when for example, in Toy Story, a toy is replaced by a newer, better toy. There is simply no sort of human behavior that can be explained in this view of social psychology. Andy holds in some ways a sort of God like power over the toys, though he is completely unaware of that power. And in what way is a human being ever replaced by a newer human being and then simply discarded?<br />
It is the authors belief, though not explicitly stated, that ostracism exists because humans cannot simply be replaced with a newer more functioning form of the same human being. The individual is instead merely ostracized. Though religion may be able to explain a phenomenon similar to the anxiety the toys feel at being replaced, there simply is no phenomena that occurs in the way that Andy is portrayed as. There can be no doubt that Andy, though he has no idea that his toys can talk, has an incredible amount of influence over the toys. Andy also interacts with them, though when he interacts with the toys it is a lifeless toy he interacts with. However, it appears that they remember and are aware of the events that take place as the humans play with them. In essence, the toys represent a sort of one-sided relationship. Andy does not communicate with them nor does he understand that the toys have feelings for him. It is therefore ostracism that comes closest to the type of dynamic that occurs between the toys when they fear being replaced as a result of Andy’s birthday gifts, but it does not come close to actual human behavior because we are not toys and toys are not capable of thoughts.<br />
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology III<br />
Finally, there is the question of Sid. We are introduced to the character very nearly in the beginning, nearly at around the same time that Buzz Lightyear is introduced. We see Sid’s apparent lack of empathy towards the toys, and since the audience views the toys as creatures capable of understanding of complex thoughts as well as pain, we view Sid’s approach to play as torture. Because we view Sid’s actions as torture the audience is able to see Sid’s image as that of a sociopath. Despite the movie’s portrayal of Sid as a sociopath, he displays interesting features that are unlike that of a sociopath. In the final confrontation of Sid by the disfigured toys we see that Sid is capable of experiencing fear. Would Sid have continued to “torture” the toys if he had known they were capable of sentient thought?<br />
Socio-interactional model states that “antisocial behavior arises early in life and is the result of poor parenting, leading a child to develop conduct problems that affect peer relations and academic performance.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014) When the audience is given a peek into the life of Sid and can take an objective look at the situation in his house, things look fairly decent. That is, Sid’s mother doesn’t appear to be abusive or neglectful and Sid still appears to have a father in the household, albeit a potentially lazy father. Furthermore, apart from bothering his sister, Sid appears to be a normal boy. The audience has the omniscient effect in that they are able to see that the toys can talk and indeed feel pain when they are tortured. However, Sid is unaware of this until the of the movie when Sid’s toys confront him. Despite the many theories of aggression, including the social-modeling theory of aggression by Albert Bandura, which theorizes that “attitude formation learning through watching what people do and whether they are rewarded or punished and then imitating that behavior” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp; Horowitz, 2014), Sid appears to be a healthy boy despite the view of the audience that Sid tortures toys. As Sid is torturing Woody with a magnifying glass, he quotes what appears to be a Star Wars quote saying “Where are your rebel friends now?” as he roleplays the role of the interrogator. Does social-psychology account for the boy’s desire to roleplay and explore different roles, even aggressive roles? Social-psychology does account for evolutionary reasons for aggression, but appears to be, to the opinion of the author, incapable of explaining the necessity for people to act out aggressive behaviors in positive ways, let alone boys who are experiencing increases of testosterone.<br />
Plausibility<br />
There is very little in the way of plausibility of Toy Story at first glance. As far as we know it, toys do not speak nor do they move on their own. However, from a social psychology perspective these toys exhibit many different facets of social psychology. First, the relationship between the toys as they relate to each other, empathize, and even unknowingly engaging in groupthink lends to the plausibility of social psychological concepts. The toys move against Woody when they assume that Woody was attempting to murder Buzz Lightyear despite having a clear lack of evidence against Woody. The toys also engage and interact with each other as a group – they very clearly show the ability to influence each other like for example, when the toys collectively panic when they see that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to the current day. They also show deeper levels of interaction – Woody and Bo Peep express romantic gestures and Woody and Slinky also express a deep sort of relationship. Woody and Buzz even express aggression and competition with each other. However, the author makes note of the insulation of the world in which the toys live in. The humans appear to be oblivious to the lives of the toys and rightly so, as generally it can be assumed that toys do not move and talk autonomously. So, from within the group and perspectives of the toys it can be said that the social psychological plausibility is very high. But once the examination of this plausibility extends further, more outward from the group it can be said that the plausibility is very low. That is, the toys only interact with themselves and of course with the humans, but the humans do not knowingly interact with the toys. In this context are the toys the Gods or fairies which manipulate the lives of humans or do humans play the role of God with the ability to destroy or create the toys and their personalities? Social psychology does not explain this, understandably.<br />
Conclusion<br />
Toy Story is arguably a story created for children. There is of course, subtle adult humor as in for example, Mr. Potato Head taking his mouth and bumping it against his backside as Slinky attempts to calm the toys in defense of Woody when it is discovered that the birthday party is today. But the story is for children. An important concept of raising children is to teach children empathy. And Toy Story utilizes the concept of using what is commonly seen as an inanimate object to portray those lessons of empathy. There are multiple reasons for this, the author believes. First is the ability to capture the attention of the toys. Children can relate to toys because they interact with toys in imaginative play. The viewing of the toys talking and interacting with each other gives children audience members an opportunity to imagine and to partake in creative play as they watch the movie. Second, being able to take the toys perspective also encourages children to take a look at another’s perspective, or to put one’s self in another’s shoes. This is another exercise in empathy. Third, the movie is able to explore some darker elements of human behavior like for example, aggression, through the use of toys so that the lesson is learned or taught without being explicit with details. In the movie death is only implied but never explicitly said; an example of this being the Bazooka Joe toy that is strapped to the rocket by Sid and is blown up. Another example being Buzz Lightyear falling out of the window as Woody attempted to hide him from Andy. In essence, low level concepts of social psychology can be taught to children with the use of toys bearing anthropomorphic features that exhibit autonomous traits like walking and talking. Of course, the plausibility of the movie from a reality standpoint as well as a psychological standpoint only goes so far as the group elements of the toys, but that cannot be helped since these elements are only explained in simplistic ideas in order to help children grasp larger elements of the need to express empathy in humanity. So, in that view Toy Story is a giant success.<br />
