  <time datetime="2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00" class="post-date">20 Mar 2020</time>
  <p>System Background and Functionality</p>

<p>Software as a service is a major function of larger companies who are looking towards the future of internet connectivity and increased efficiency between businesses and clients. Essentially, the majority of work usually done by sales representatives of Print-R-Us is moved to an online location in which customers can use an online software that allows for them to easily and quickly design media with near endless customizability to suit whatever needs a potential client has. This software is designed with the lay person in mind; to remember that the client may or may not know how to utilize a computer at their home or at a kiosk in the Print-R-Us storefronts. It is also designed with a “power-user” in mind; someone who may be a media professional that works with their own clients.</p>

<p>Two immediate results include:</p>

<p>First, customers no longer need to translate ideas to a salesperson who, due to miscommunication or time constraints is unable to fully understand the client’s needs as to what or how a certain project a client wishes the appearance, functionality and use ought to be and instead can utilize easy to use software and related kiosks (which will also run the same software hosted on the internet) to fully meet all needs of the client. This is accomplished through the use of software as a service hosted on the internet. (SaaS)</p>

<p>Second, financial transactions will stay the same in the store front. Print-R-Us will continue to charge for material and printing but instead will be able to pass on cost cutting savings onto the customer by freeing up sales personnel to instead provide a fulfilling sales environment and two, quicker financial processing for orders on the store front side.<br />
When customers utilize the software from their homes the financial transaction is processed through eCommerce software in which the transactions are processed through SSL, or secure socket layering encryption. This is an encryption process that is standard across most if not all industries in which sensitive information such as credit card information and names and addresses are passed through a web browser to a server.</p>

<p>The major benefit to processing orders through an online service is that the service allows Print-R-Us to continue to do business even with store hour limitations. It takes little imagination as to see why this is a huge benefit for the total income of Print-R-Us.</p>

<p>Productivity</p>

<p>Productivity in customer handling, financial transactions, and customer service can be exponentially increased in the following ways.<br />
First, emphasis is made upon the customer handling and service because customer handling and service is the bottle neck to sales. The majority of customer sales representative will be moved first to kiosk usage and training. These customer sales representatives will instead be trained to encourage new customers and old customers to dream. These new representatives will focus instead on building the sales environment in which a customer is encouraged to design any and all media to unlimited potential. And because the majority of the building of the media project is handled by the customer, the sales representatives are now free to spend time floating from customer to customer to answer any basic graphical user interface questions as well as recommendations to certain kinds of media. It is at this point a customer sales representative can be allowed liberty to “up-sell” the client on premium materials as well as the branching out of new forms of media related to the project a customer has in mind when he or she walks into the store.</p>

<p>Second, wiki software is used to develop employees who were once sales representatives into “online service providers” in which these employees are paid a basic wage but are paid a premium for every customer question answered and in turn, the customer’s positive reviews of the answered question. These same employees will now be placed in charge of building wiki spaces in which basic questions are answered as well as providing examples of the creativity a customer can employ in the use of the software as a service (SaaS) that the kiosk or their own personal computer provides. The exercises these employees receive will allow them to move up and down the ladder from store-front sales representatives to being able to work as “online service providers”. Working either way allows these employees full perspective on the software and the service that Print-R-Us store fronts provide: legendary customer service, expert knowledge of craft, as well as expedient service (which the kiosks facilitate).</p>

<p>And finally, financial transactions will mostly remain the same. However, new additions will be made to the ability to make a transaction. Kiosks connected to the internet will give the customer the opportunity to pay through the kiosk instead of a sales representative. This kiosk will allow a customer to “suspend” a transaction to allow a sales representative to personally look through the order and should the customer wish, allow a sales representative to finalize the transaction him or herself.</p>

<p>Information Privacy and Information Security</p>

<p>Before making the final transition to cloud based storage of sensitive customer information, data will be stored in local store kiosks. If a customer needs to make a transition from one store to another, the information will first be placed onto an encrypted USB storage device that will only work at Print-R-Us kiosks as well as with a required 4-digit PIN number assigned by the customer.</p>

<p>The final transition of the software as a service selling environment will be with a 6 month beta-test period in which before sensitive data is placed into the cloud, the source code of the information will be posted online as well as a challenge to other hackers. The prize money for finding exploits will be $100 dollars per exploit. This will encourage outsiders with experience in unconventional exploitative methods to find vulnerabilities in the software. This fact of testing will be advertised to customers.</p>

<p>Though customers have the option to have the product delivered to their homes in a discrete package, some customers may choose to pick up their packages at Print-R-Us storefronts. Because privacy and informational security is now emphasized at Print-R-Us, sales representatives now deliver the final product to the consumer in a sealed envelope or package.</p>

<p>Finally, methods through email and sales representatives will be passed onto the customer in whom he or she can protect oneself from attacks. Print-R-Us will become a definitive authority on internet security and at this point can branch off into another way to increase sales transactions through the selling of security devices or related products.</p>

<p>Other Ethical Issues</p>

<p>First, protection for the consumer – emphasize sales representatives do NOT look at the order creation process and only see the final cover page of the media. (Kiosks will include a cover page of the customer name and information that is covered media.)<br />
Second, the problem may occur in which the client is producing material that is illegal or violates copyright issues. The sales representative is in such a position in which he or she does not see the material themselves but if the issue were to be presented to the sales representative, the policy on such issues need and must be clearly stated to the customer. That is, that Print-R-Us does NOT encourage the distribution of illegal material or the violation of copyright laws. This stance must be emphasized at all levels of the customer’s creative process that must remind the customer that while creativity is unlimited, boundaries are put in place to keep a client from violating upon the rights of others.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>Print-R-Us must look toward the future. Employees will want to spend less of their time at store-fronts and more of their time either working at a job with a higher paying wage or working from home or going to school. Employees can find a solid foundation at Print-R-Us with the utilization of a schedule in which employees are allowed time to work from home as “online service providers” as well as being able to work at store fronts. When working from home Print-R-Us can pay lower wages and instead focus on the performance of an employee based on solid questions answered from clients. This keeps employees on two sides of the Print-R-Us model, both of which allow for the employees to be well crafted and knowledgeable in Print-R-Us values and goals. With less employees at store fronts afforded by the use of multiple kiosks, which the initial payoff of the machines pay off themselves quickly with the ability to have to use less employees at store fronts as well as being more effective in handling customer questions and concerns and faster transactions, the kiosks and software as a service as a positive step into the future becomes clear.</p>

<p>With modern encryption and with the encouragement of hackers being paid off to work on exploits and vulnerabilities found in the source code of the online software, countless amount of dollars originally used to troubleshoot and maintain the software can instead be used to grow the company, branch into different businesses, or even provide a higher quality sales environment in which the customers walk into with each store front. The biggest issue with software as a service and cloud based storage arises with the potential for data breaches. This is why it is absolutely essential to find amateur and expert hackers alike who are already driven and passionate on this topic to find for us the problems which we may not see and may lie inherent in the software itself. The cost of paying $100 to a hacker per exploit can be much cheaper than hiring a network of software technicians and programmers to maintain the site. Instead, the online software should be corrected by the hackers themselves and the maintenance of the software to a small handful of employees who are either contracted out or trained from within the company to implement the improvements found by the hackers to further the software to higher potential.</p>

<p>With transferring the employees who normally would have lost their jobs as a result of a smaller workforce multiplied by the use of kiosks into a position of creating and maintaining a wiki of Print-R-Us, employees are given another chance to develop another skill which is marketable, productive, and well worth the hourly or salary wages Print-R-Us already pays its employees. Instead of paying an initial upfront cost of hiring or creating more software to provide answers and customer service to clients who are seeking more information on the software usage, these same employees who normally would have been laid off will now work to create the wiki page to answer all questions customers may have as well as premeditating potential questions or problems by creating articles an even creating examples of the potential of the online software Print-R-Us will utilize to allow customers to create their own projects without the use of sales representatives.</p>

<p>Essentially, the costs of creating a new future for Print-R-Us can be had for a low cost. The biggest cost will be in the purchase and creation of the software to be used online. But the initial pay will return dividends as a long term investment into a productive business model in which employees and customers alike are happy and fulfilled.</p>
