<meta name="description" content="Kon Ham EDU445 Determine Your Role in the Advocacy Effort The advocacy role I have determined to use in this approach is the self-advocacy approach. Specifically, self-advocacy refers to those with specific needs needing to be advocated for to have that done for themselves rather than through the representation of others. I have chosen this form of advocacy because I chose not to represent any group nor affiliate myself with a group. Therefore, this form of advocacy on behalf of changing minimum state standards for early child hood educators is based on my own experience. My plan for self-advocacy is the utilization of a key stakeholder – the parents, therefore being able to make decisions and make actions on my own basis rather than through an organization or agency will allow me to work with parents quickly and efficiently so that I can push my advocacy forward. Another advantage to self-advocacy is that it takes less effort to organize. Since I am an advocate to myself on behalf of a cause I feel strongly about, I only need to organize myself instead of the various other people I might have to coordinate with in order to represent them. This simplifies logistics for me. Though there is a benefit to being financially supported through mutual groups, I still reject citizen advocacy because of the organizational factor. I want to present myself as an unbiased individual. When I am representing groups or agencies I can potentially be seen as an individual with vested interest and benefits I would gain from representing other agencies. When I act as a self-advocate, I can present myself as an individual with reasonable conclusions based on research and experience that I have gained personally. I believe in some ways this makes me more trustworthy since I have a face and a name that I can be held accountable to. The three resources I will utilize as I begin my advocacy efforts are writing blog posts, learning to work with media and the media, and building relationships with political candidates. I can find the first two on websites such as WordPress, as well as the local newspaper where I can submit an opinion piece concerning my subject matter. Finally, I can also utilize the internet to get a hold of my local representatives and reach out to them through the use of the internet or a physical letter. Furthermore, when I have created a blog, I now have access to millions of other blogs. Within these numerous blogs, I can identify those that would be interested in my position of advocacy. I am not the first educator to start a blog, and when I have one, I can make comments and exchange ideas with other educators. I am beginning this advocacy of increased childcare educator standards because I have come to this conclusion through research and experience. So, I can exchange that information with other educators and stakeholders – perhaps they will come to the same conclusion as I will and I can be further encouraged to advocacy, or perhaps the will modify or reach another conclusion with the information I’ve shared and I can modify my advocacy to better fit the good for stakeholders. When I have a newspaper, I can utilize the resource of credibility. While blogs are very easy to begin and self-publish, still in the minds of the general population a newspaper holds higher credentials. I can send my opinions to these newspaper agencies and perhaps one of them will publish my opinion. This is an advantage to me because I can point readers to my blog while at the same time presenting my information on a credible platform. When I need to reach out to policy makers, I can utilize Twitter because if my information is accurate and concise, policy makers can usually respond back within the same day, if not within seconds. Identify the Stakeholders of This Macro-Level Advocacy Effort Because I am working by myself and am developing advocacy through self-advocacy, I have selected two stakeholders through which to disseminate my advocacy. The first stakeholder will be the general population. I am looking to change minimum state requirements so I must first attempt to discuss my issue with the general population, which can later leverage my position to policy makers. I would start by creating a blog in which I advocate my cause. Because a blog is easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, I don’t have to go through a publisher such as a newspaper and hope to be published. With the general public I can write my blog as if I am a concerned citizen with a credentialed background in education. I can present my case as it relates to society as a whole and what raising the minimum standard can do as it would directly benefit the public with more well-behaved children as a result of higher education of educators. When I write my blog, I write in plain English. I am not speaking to credentialed educators. I am speaking to a general population of people so I speak plainly. The content of the information when I write to the general population would be slanted so that I can focus on impact of cost that low or minimal standards for educators would be for the average tax payer. I would also focus on the potential for job growth for local market involved in the credentialing process of newer and stricter standards for childhood educators. Second, another stakeholder would be other educators. Again, on my blog I can again to my educators that I am an advocate that is in the field of which he is advocating. I am not just a distant person that is disconnected from the industry. Utilizing this blog, I can establish my credentials as well as using my credentials to advocate for my cause. When I write, I remind my readers and potential stakeholders, educators, that I have an informed opinion because I am a school administrator. To educators as stakeholders, I remind them that I am witnessing first hand accounts of the troubles related to minimal state standards for childhood educators. I could for example speak on how ill-prepared newly minted educators are when they arrive into the schooling environment and how this disrupts the learning environment because educators become stressed with adjusting to a reality to which their education did not prepare them for. Third, I will also identify policy makers as another stakeholder. I am attempting to change state requirements. I am unable to do this unless I run for office. Therefore, I can instead reach out to my local, state, and federal policy makers in order to ask them to consider the change in state requirements. I can do this easily through the use of Twitter. Twitter allows my comments to reach inside their pockets. Because most policy makers have phones to access Twitter or give their staff members access to their official Twitter account, I can directly communicate with them. My approach with policy makers will be that of an advisor. I do not want to lobby so I will not make a request for action. However, being in a position of advisor holds benefits, so I can utilize the Twitter platform to directly hand off key information for policy makers that supports my view. And fourthly, I will identify parents as another key stakeholder. Parents are the ones that drop their children off to childcare centers as well as being the primary financial sponsors of children in being able to pay for the educational tuition. Therefore, parents ought to have a very invested interest in raising the educational standards of early childhood educators. For parents, I will explain to them that the biggest advantage to having a higher standard would be that parents can trust the educators that receive these credentials. Parents likely have a harder time as general lay people deciding which teacher would be the best for their child. If there could be some form of a credentialed service for parents that they can trust as a general source of authoritative information, they would be able to rest assured that the educators receiving these credentials would be trustworthy. Although advocacy and lobbying have similar agendas, it is the action part of lobbying or advocacy that separates the two forms. Advocacy involves the sharing and spreading of knowledge and information of which you are either for or against. Lobbying involves advocacy plus the usage of requesting a political official to move in action for or against a topic of discussion. When I as an educator am requesting that a policy maker vote for or against a subject, I am directly lobbying. However, when I am educating or informing a policy maker on the topic that I am advocating, this stands as advocacy. My blog posts and newspaper opinion submissions are not requesting any call to action, only merely demonstrating the benefits of changing the minimum standards of early childhood educators. Furthermore, when I am reaching out to policy makers through Twitter, I do not make any call to action and I do my best to remain ignorant of upcoming bills and laws. But it is still helpful to include policymakers in the advocacy process because of their larger platform. I do not have to present a call to action to these people. Just the fact that their platform caters to hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions of people gives me an advantage in being able to include them into the advocacy process. Furthermore, they hold an authoritative position in policy. Being able to include a policy maker in my advocacy further increases the credibility of my stance. Identify One Stakeholder to Collaborate With, and Create a Plan for Collaboration The stakeholder I have identified with for further collaboration would be parents. I do not use the general population, educators, nor policy makers for collaboration for the following reasons. I am able to see the parents every day. This makes them ideal candidates for collaboration. Educators have their own agenda to follow and often times in order to collaborate with them I may have to go through an agency or a group. The general population only exists as an abstract concept and would be difficult for me to meet with the general population to advise and inform them on my advocacy stance. Finally, policy makers are distant and I am likely unable to meet with these people for very cheap. Because I want to keep my platform cost efficient, I do not utilize policy makers for collaboration. Educators may be interested in collaboration, but perhaps they would have vested interest in keeping the standards low so that they can afford cheaper labor overall for their businesses, if they operate as a business owner. This would mean that they would either not be very interested at all in collaborating with my advocacy or that they would be against it completely. Parents are naturally involved in stakeholder engagement. They bring their children into class and are invested in seeing their children grow and develop to the best of their abilities. Therefore, as an educator I have a shared purpose, vision, and buy-in with the parents. With a policy maker my shared purpose may be similar with him or her but the buy-in may be different. With trust and a sense of interdependence, I would have to develop that over a long period of time. With parents I have already begun the establishment of the trust and interdependence. With parents, the indicators of progress however may be different. Parents may want to see their children to grow up well but may be completely uninterested in policy changes. They may have the “good enough is good enough” attitude concerning revised standards for early childhood educators. However, with a policymaker I could potentially have similar indicators of progress with him or her. If my intention was to change policy, then the policy maker would also look at policy changes as a key indicator that change is happening and that what he or she wants is coming to fruition. My strategy would be first to introduce personally to the parents the need for a greater educational requirement for educators when they enroll their child or children into my school. I would explain to them the difference between my own colleagues and that of other educators at other schools. I would begin by explaining to them that it is relatively easy to be employed at a child care facility and that the requirements are very lax. When parents begin to see the difference between my child care center and that of my competitors, I can move to my second phase – I would then ask parents to visit the other child care centers and ask if the educators at that facility are credentialed. Likely the answer at the other facility will be that of confusion because there is no credentialing process for a person to be employed and teach at a child care center. My child care center would stand out from others because I would explain to these parents that my educators have credentials beyond that of the basic continuing education that is mandatory for each state. I would explain that these courses are chosen by the educators beyond what is mandatory for the state because the educators at my facility have an excellence approach to continuing education. From here I would lament that this process is not standard for all child care facilities to the parents. I would explain to the parents that I have a blog started in which I am advocating for further standards for child care educators and that I am in currently in the process of speaking with policy makers as well as submitting opinion articles to newspapers. I would then encourage the parents to also speak with others and policy makers about the need for higher standards for child care educators. They have already begun this process if they, after having interviewed my child care facility and have gone to another facility asking about further “credentials”. Though of course the other facility would explain that no, there are no specific credentials for their educators that there is a basic continuing education law that their teachers follow. From there, I would then contact policy makers and mention that parents have been asking for increased standards for early childhood educators. I would mention to the policy makers that the standards are influencing negative affects and that parents, their constituents, are developing a growing concern for such increased standards on a statewide level. There would be no direct form of lobbying because there may be no active vote for or against my advocacy stance and second, so far I have only identified the need for raising standards, not exactly what those increased standards should be on a statewide level of certification." />

But it is still helpful to include policymakers in the advocacy process because of their larger platform. I do not have to present a call to action to these people. Just the fact that their platform caters to hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions of people gives me an advantage in being able to include them into the advocacy process. Furthermore, they hold an authoritative position in policy. Being able to include a policy maker in my advocacy further increases the credibility of my stance. Identify One Stakeholder to Collaborate With, and Create a Plan for Collaboration The stakeholder I have identified with for further collaboration would be parents. I do not use the general population, educators, nor policy makers for collaboration for the following reasons. I am able to see the parents every day. This makes them ideal candidates for collaboration. Educators have their own agenda to follow and often times in order to collaborate with them I may have to go through an agency or a group. The general population only exists as an abstract concept and would be difficult for me to meet with the general population to advise and inform them on my advocacy stance. Finally, policy makers are distant and I am likely unable to meet with these people for very cheap. Because I want to keep my platform cost efficient, I do not utilize policy makers for collaboration. Educators may be interested in collaboration, but perhaps they would have vested interest in keeping the standards low so that they can afford cheaper labor overall for their businesses, if they operate as a business owner. This would mean that they would either not be very interested at all in collaborating with my advocacy or that they would be against it completely. Parents are naturally involved in stakeholder engagement. They bring their children into class and are invested in seeing their children grow and develop to the best of their abilities. Therefore, as an educator I have a shared purpose, vision, and buy-in with the parents. With a policy maker my shared purpose may be similar with him or her but the buy-in may be different. With trust and a sense of interdependence, I would have to develop that over a long period of time. With parents I have already begun the establishment of the trust and interdependence. With parents, the indicators of progress however may be different. Parents may want to see their children to grow up well but may be completely uninterested in policy changes. They may have the “good enough is good enough” attitude concerning revised standards for early childhood educators. However, with a policymaker I could potentially have similar indicators of progress with him or her. If my intention was to change policy, then the policy maker would also look at policy changes as a key indicator that change is happening and that what he or she wants is coming to fruition. My strategy would be first to introduce personally to the parents the need for a greater educational requirement for educators when they enroll their child or children into my school. I would explain to them the difference between my own colleagues and that of other educators at other schools. I would begin by explaining to them that it is relatively easy to be employed at a child care facility and that the requirements are very lax. When parents begin to see the difference between my child care center and that of my competitors, I can move to my second phase – I would then ask parents to visit the other child care centers and ask if the educators at that facility are credentialed. Likely the answer at the other facility will be that of confusion because there is no credentialing process for a person to be employed and teach at a child care center. My child care center would stand out from others because I would explain to these parents that my educators have credentials beyond that of the basic continuing education that is mandatory for each state. I would explain that these courses are chosen by the educators beyond what is mandatory for the state because the educators at my facility have an excellence approach to continuing education. From here I would lament that this process is not standard for all child care facilities to the parents. I would explain to the parents that I have a blog started in which I am advocating for further standards for child care educators and that I am in currently in the process of speaking with policy makers as well as submitting opinion articles to newspapers. I would then encourage the parents to also speak with others and policy makers about the need for higher standards for child care educators. They have already begun this process if they, after having interviewed my child care facility and have gone to another facility asking about further “credentials”. Though of course the other facility would explain that no, there are no specific credentials for their educators that there is a basic continuing education law that their teachers follow. From there, I would then contact policy makers and mention that parents have been asking for increased standards for early childhood educators. I would mention to the policy makers that the standards are influencing negative affects and that parents, their constituents, are developing a growing concern for such increased standards on a statewide level. There would be no direct form of lobbying because there may be no active vote for or against my advocacy stance and second, so far I have only identified the need for raising standards, not exactly what those increased standards should be on a statewide level of certification.","headline":"EDU445 Advancing the Profession Final Project 1 (I explore advocacy roles)","dateModified":"2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00","datePublished":"2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/edu445-advancing-the-professional-final-project-1/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mark Otto"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/edu445-advancing-the-professional-final-project-1/","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

Determine Your Role in the Advocacy Effort<br />
The advocacy role I have determined to use in this approach is the self-advocacy approach. Specifically, self-advocacy refers to those with specific needs needing to be advocated for to have that done for themselves rather than through the representation of others. I have chosen this form of advocacy because I chose not to represent any group nor affiliate myself with a group. Therefore, this form of advocacy on behalf of changing minimum state standards for early child hood educators is based on my own experience. My plan for self-advocacy is the utilization of a key stakeholder – the parents, therefore being able to make decisions and make actions on my own basis rather than through an organization or agency will allow me to work with parents quickly and efficiently so that I can push my advocacy forward.<br />
Another advantage to self-advocacy is that it takes less effort to organize. Since I am an advocate to myself on behalf of a cause I feel strongly about, I only need to organize myself instead of the various other people I might have to coordinate with in order to represent them. This simplifies logistics for me. Though there is a benefit to being financially supported through mutual groups, I still reject citizen advocacy because of the organizational factor. I want to present myself as an unbiased individual. When I am representing groups or agencies I can potentially be seen as an individual with vested interest and benefits I would gain from representing other agencies. When I act as a self-advocate, I can present myself as an individual with reasonable conclusions based on research and experience that I have gained personally. I believe in some ways this makes me more trustworthy since I have a face and a name that I can be held accountable to.<br />
The three resources I will utilize as I begin my advocacy efforts are writing blog posts, learning to work with media and the media, and building relationships with political candidates. I can find the first two on websites such as WordPress, as well as the local newspaper where I can submit an opinion piece concerning my subject matter. Finally, I can also utilize the internet to get a hold of my local representatives and reach out to them through the use of the internet or a physical letter. Furthermore, when I have created a blog, I now have access to millions of other blogs. Within these numerous blogs, I can identify those that would be interested in my position of advocacy. I am not the first educator to start a blog, and when I have one, I can make comments and exchange ideas with other educators. I am beginning this advocacy of increased childcare educator standards because I have come to this conclusion through research and experience. So, I can exchange that information with other educators and stakeholders – perhaps they will come to the same conclusion as I will and I can be further encouraged to advocacy, or perhaps the will modify or reach another conclusion with the information I’ve shared and I can modify my advocacy to better fit the good for stakeholders. When I have a newspaper, I can utilize the resource of credibility. While blogs are very easy to begin and self-publish, still in the minds of the general population a newspaper holds higher credentials. I can send my opinions to these newspaper agencies and perhaps one of them will publish my opinion. This is an advantage to me because I can point readers to my blog while at the same time presenting my information on a credible platform. When I need to reach out to policy makers, I can utilize Twitter because if my information is accurate and concise, policy makers can usually respond back within the same day, if not within seconds.<br />
Identify the Stakeholders of This Macro-Level Advocacy Effort<br />
Because I am working by myself and am developing advocacy through self-advocacy, I have selected two stakeholders through which to disseminate my advocacy. The first stakeholder will be the general population. I am looking to change minimum state requirements so I must first attempt to discuss my issue with the general population, which can later leverage my position to policy makers. I would start by creating a blog in which I advocate my cause. Because a blog is easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, I don’t have to go through a publisher such as a newspaper and hope to be published. With the general public I can write my blog as if I am a concerned citizen with a credentialed background in education. I can present my case as it relates to society as a whole and what raising the minimum standard can do as it would directly benefit the public with more well-behaved children as a result of higher education of educators. When I write my blog, I write in plain English. I am not speaking to credentialed educators. I am speaking to a general population of people so I speak plainly. The content of the information when I write to the general population would be slanted so that I can focus on impact of cost that low or minimal standards for educators would be for the average tax payer. I would also focus on the potential for job growth for local market involved in the credentialing process of newer and stricter standards for childhood educators.<br />
Second, another stakeholder would be other educators. Again, on my blog I can again to my educators that I am an advocate that is in the field of which he is advocating. I am not just a distant person that is disconnected from the industry. Utilizing this blog, I can establish my credentials as well as using my credentials to advocate for my cause. When I write, I remind my readers and potential stakeholders, educators, that I have an informed opinion because I am a school administrator. To educators as stakeholders, I remind them that I am witnessing first hand accounts of the troubles related to minimal state standards for childhood educators. I could for example speak on how ill-prepared newly minted educators are when they arrive into the schooling environment and how this disrupts the learning environment because educators become stressed with adjusting to a reality to which their education did not prepare them for.<br />
Third, I will also identify policy makers as another stakeholder. I am attempting to change state requirements. I am unable to do this unless I run for office. Therefore, I can instead reach out to my local, state, and federal policy makers in order to ask them to consider the change in state requirements. I can do this easily through the use of Twitter. Twitter allows my comments to reach inside their pockets. Because most policy makers have phones to access Twitter or give their staff members access to their official Twitter account, I can directly communicate with them. My approach with policy makers will be that of an advisor. I do not want to lobby so I will not make a request for action. However, being in a position of advisor holds benefits, so I can utilize the Twitter platform to directly hand off key information for policy makers that supports my view.<br />
And fourthly, I will identify parents as another key stakeholder. Parents are the ones that drop their children off to childcare centers as well as being the primary financial sponsors of children in being able to pay for the educational tuition. Therefore, parents ought to have a very invested interest in raising the educational standards of early childhood educators. For parents, I will explain to them that the biggest advantage to having a higher standard would be that parents can trust the educators that receive these credentials. Parents likely have a harder time as general lay people deciding which teacher would be the best for their child. If there could be some form of a credentialed service for parents that they can trust as a general source of authoritative information, they would be able to rest assured that the educators receiving these credentials would be trustworthy.<br />
Although advocacy and lobbying have similar agendas, it is the action part of lobbying or advocacy that separates the two forms. Advocacy involves the sharing and spreading of knowledge and information of which you are either for or against. Lobbying involves advocacy plus the usage of requesting a political official to move in action for or against a topic of discussion. When I as an educator am requesting that a policy maker vote for or against a subject, I am directly lobbying. However, when I am educating or informing a policy maker on the topic that I am advocating, this stands as advocacy.<br />
My blog posts and newspaper opinion submissions are not requesting any call to action, only merely demonstrating the benefits of changing the minimum standards of early childhood educators. Furthermore, when I am reaching out to policy makers through Twitter, I do not make any call to action and I do my best to remain ignorant of upcoming bills and laws. But it is still helpful to include policymakers in the advocacy process because of their larger platform. I do not have to present a call to action to these people. Just the fact that their platform caters to hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions of people gives me an advantage in being able to include them into the advocacy process. Furthermore, they hold an authoritative position in policy. Being able to include a policy maker in my advocacy further increases the credibility of my stance.<br />
Identify One Stakeholder to Collaborate With, and Create a Plan for Collaboration<br />
The stakeholder I have identified with for further collaboration would be parents. I do not use the general population, educators, nor policy makers for collaboration for the following reasons. I am able to see the parents every day. This makes them ideal candidates for collaboration. Educators have their own agenda to follow and often times in order to collaborate with them I may have to go through an agency or a group. The general population only exists as an abstract concept and would be difficult for me to meet with the general population to advise and inform them on my advocacy stance. Finally, policy makers are distant and I am likely unable to meet with these people for very cheap. Because I want to keep my platform cost efficient, I do not utilize policy makers for collaboration. Educators may be interested in collaboration, but perhaps they would have vested interest in keeping the standards low so that they can afford cheaper labor overall for their businesses, if they operate as a business owner. This would mean that they would either not be very interested at all in collaborating with my advocacy or that they would be against it completely.<br />
