<meta name="description" content="“My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others”, said Dranafile Bojaxhiu to her daughter, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) What Dranafile said to Agnes must have left an impact on her because later Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu legacy would be that her order “included hundreds of centers in more than 90 countries with some 4,000 nuns and hundreds of thousands of lay workers.” (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Not only that, she grew to receive “…the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian honors”, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) being gifted Pope Paul VI’s ceremonial limousine and raffling it to finance her leper colony, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018), and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) This is the story of Mother Theresa. Here I will describe Mother Theresa’s life through the use of three personality theories and the foundational elements in Mother Theresa’s life that would have steered her personality one way or another. The personality theories I will use will be the humanistic approach and the social learning approach. The four influences I will use to describe the development of Mother Theresa’s life will be as follows: the death of her father at age 9 and the subsequent influence her mother had on her life, the spiritual calling of her life at 12, becoming a nun at 18, and at 19 moving to India and the subsequent calling she received to go to Calcutta to reach to the poorest of the poor. Mother Theresa was born in Skopje, Macedonia on August 27, 1910. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) She was born in the last breaths of the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Macedonia at the time. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) Her mother and father were grocers. Her family was deeply religious (Biography.com Editors, 2018) and her father was “deeply involved” in both the local church as well as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence (Biography.com Editors, 2018), which was the source of Mother Theresa’s ethnicity. Her father had passed when Mother Theresa was the age of 9. While the source of Mother Theresa’s father’s death was not known, it was sudden and speculated at her father’s political enemies may have poisoned him. (Biography.com Editors, 2018)" />

  <p>“My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others”, said Dranafile Bojaxhiu to her daughter, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) What Dranafile said to Agnes must have left an impact on her because later Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu legacy would be that her order “included hundreds of centers in more than 90 countries with some 4,000 nuns and hundreds of thousands of lay workers.” (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Not only that, she grew to receive “…the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian honors”, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) being gifted Pope Paul VI’s ceremonial limousine and raffling it to finance her leper colony, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018), and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) This is the story of Mother Theresa. Here I will describe Mother Theresa’s life through the use of three personality theories and the foundational elements in Mother Theresa’s life that would have steered her personality one way or another. The personality theories I will use will be the humanistic approach and the social learning approach. The four influences I will use to describe the development of Mother Theresa’s life will be as follows: the death of her father at age 9 and the subsequent influence her mother had on her life, the spiritual calling of her life at 12, becoming a nun at 18, and at 19 moving to India and the subsequent calling she received to go to Calcutta to reach to the poorest of the poor. Mother Theresa was born in Skopje, Macedonia on August 27, 1910. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) She was born in the last breaths of the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Macedonia at the time. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) Her mother and father were grocers. Her family was deeply religious (Biography.com Editors, 2018) and her father was “deeply involved” in both the local church as well as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence (Biography.com Editors, 2018), which was the source of Mother Theresa’s ethnicity. Her father had passed when Mother Theresa was the age of 9. While the source of Mother Theresa’s father’s death was not known, it was sudden and speculated at her father’s political enemies may have poisoned him. (Biography.com Editors, 2018)</p>

<p>Mother Theresa’s own mother also had a huge influence upon her life. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Her mother, Drana was known as a pious and compassionate woman. It was Drana who told then Agnes, “My child, my child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others” when Agnes asked who these strangers were in their house after Drana had invited the “destitute” (Biography.com Editors, 2018) of the city to dine with the family. Continuing, Drana said “Some of them are our relations, but all of them are our people.” Agnes also attended a convent-run primary school (Biography.com Editors, 2018) which along with Drana and Nikola, Agnes’ father, which may have set her on the path to a career in the spiritual realm. At 12 she received a calling into ministry. Specifically, her congregation made an annual trip to the Church of the Black Madonna, in Letnice. On one such trip she received her calling. At age 18, she left for Dublin, Ireland and she took the name Sister Mary Theresa.<br />
Here, Mother Theresa’s extraordinary skill is portrayed. She taught for 17 years in Calcutta, India. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) She was specifically there to teach the poorest of the poor in Calcutta. Here she learned Bengali and Hindi while teaching geography and history. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) On May 24, 1937, Mother Theresa took her Final Professional of Vows which included a “life of poverty, chastity, and obedience. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) This was the event where Mother Theresa finally took the title of “mother”. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Here in Calcutta, at Saint Mary’s she continued teaching and eventually becoming the principle of the school.<br />
While riding a train from Calcutta to the Himalayan foothills for a retreat, she received what became known as Mother Theresa’s “call within a call” where she says Jesus Christ spoke to her to leave teaching for helping the poorest of the poor. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) However, she needed to gain approval from the Vatican because she had taken a vow to obedience to the church. She finally took approval from the Vatican and she donned the blue and white sari that she became so famously known for. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Here afterwards she founded an organization called the Missionaries of Charities which received official status as a religious community from the Archdiocese of Calcutta. This organization attracted many financial support as well as volunteers. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) Not only did she help the poorest of the poor receive education, she also founded a leper community and an orphanage for abandoned children as well as a hospice for the terminally ill. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Her work received wide support and recognition from not only governments and organizations but also from the Pope himself. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) She did not attend her Nobel Peace prize ceremony but instead asked that the Nobel Peace prize fund be given to the poor. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018)<br />
The final part of her life was marked with health problems. However, even all the while she was ailed with sickness and health problems; she continued to travel to her various organizations, the Missionaries of Charity to promote the organization’s cause to help the poor and needy. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018) She died within a week of Princess Diana’s death, another popular figure associated with the helping of the poor and needy. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018) Years after her death, her letters had surfaced which indicated that during the last 50 years of her life she had felt a distance from God and the suffering she experienced from that. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) However she never abandoned the faith and remained committed to God. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Posthumously and throughout her career as Mother Theresa, she was awarded many times over. Such examples include the Nobel Peace Prize, the Honorary Citizenship of the United States, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Nehru Prize, and the list continues. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018)<br />
Humanism is the study of the person, “the whole person, and the uniqueness of the individual.” (Mcleod, 2015) Both the psychodynamic and behavioral schools of psychology saw the individual as a byproduct of a series of deterministic events; with psychodynamic psychology the innate subconscious forces that drive the individual and with the view of behavioral psychology the result of the individual in the terms of both stimulus and response. (Mcleod, 2015) In humanistic psychology, the basic belief is that the individual is innately good, humans have free will in the form of personal agency, and emphasizes “the worth of the individual, centrality of human values, and the creative, active nature of human beings.” (Mcleod, 2015) The second emphasis that is important to humanism is the concept of self-actualization. Self-actualization deals with “psychological growth, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life”. (Mcleod, 2015) Furthermore, humanism deals with the belief that personal growth and fulfillment are basic to human motivation. (Mcleod, 2015) Both Rogers and Maslow, important figures in humanism, view differently how self-actualization is to be accomplished but the basic belief that self-actualization is the goal of an individual is the same. Mother Theresa is an excellent example of the need to self-actualize. She is also an excellent example of a human being that fits the “humans are innately good” perspective. Although Mother Theresa says she felt that by God she was called to ministry to help the poor and needy, it was through her own personal agency that she felt compelled to follow this call from God.<br />
Observational learning is the bridge between classical and operant conditioning. This theory was proposed by Albert Bandura. (Mcleod, 2008) Onto these two learning theories he adds another two ideas: mediation occurs between stimulus and response and second, behavior is learned through observational learning. (Mcleod, 2008) There are 4 processes to the meditational process of behavioral learning. First phase is the attention phase. The behavior is noticed. (Mcleod, 2008) The second phase is the retention phase which is how well the behavior is remembered. (Mcleod, 2008) Third is the reproduction phase which is the ability to perform the behavior observed. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally is the motivation phase which is the fourth phase. In this phase the will to perform the behavior is noticed. Motivation to perform the behavior involves the processing of the rewards or risks involved with the behavior and whether or not the individual wishes to process and perform the behavior. (Mcleod, 2008) Mother Theresa’s both mother and father had social Christian perspectives. That is, they both went out to practice the application of Christianity in their own lives – her father in politics and Albanian independence, and her mother who would invite the entire city to dine at their own house, specifically the destitute. Mother Theresa, then Agnes, would have much to witness and positive influences to want to model.<br />
Specifically, there are four influences in her life that may have directly influenced her to become the Mother Theresa we all so well know today. The four influences and events are, the passing of her father at age 9, the calling she received to go into ministry at 12, becoming a nun at 18, and moving to India at 19. Some of us may have memories of being a child at 9. This was for most of us third or fourth grade. Her father passed at this age and may well have left a mark on her knowing that her father was deeply devoted to God and to social work. Later, when she was older she would have also experienced and witnessed seeing her mother also deeply involved in the church and inviting people over that were not family and were practically strangers to dinner.<br />
Although not much of her young life is known, it could be assumed that when she was younger Agnes would have seen much of her father and mother’s experiences of self-actualization at the work they were committing to in the name of the Lord. At 12 Agnes reports having had a calling by God to go into ministry. This may have been the fulfillment of her mother and father’s own legacy upon her. At 18, she took vows to become a nun and would likely have been around many other fellow believers that were self-actualizing and also portraying the positive intrinsic benefits to a life devoted to the Lord. When 19 and after having been in India for some time and having taken the title of “Mother” she would also have experienced the self-actualizing experience of her final vows to obedience to the Church and to God.<br />
Being that humanism and social learning was applied toward the application of Mother Theresa, it would be appropriate to make an analysis of Mother Theresa regarding uniqueness vs. universality theories of human personality. Mother Theresa displayed many characteristics unique to the world and the impact she’s made thereof. Humanists would view that these traits were representative of her own unique ability manifested in her desire to self-actualize. Social learning theory, which is based in learning in regards to classical and operant conditioning, would argue that Mother Theresa was a product of her environment, given that she had grown up in a religious home. This would be a nurture effect of her life.<br />
In the role of assessment through the perspective of social learning theory, it would be appropriate to see the relationship between Agnes and her mother and father. If her mother and father had both been around at the time and assessment was being conducted, we could see how much of an impact her parents had upon Mother Theresa’s life. For example, what if her father had not died at the age of 9 – would she still have become a nun? And suppose that both her mother and father were not religious at all? Would she still have become the great Mother Theresa after having had an experience in which she felt God was calling her to ministry? In the perspective of humanism, qualitative study would have been made, since humanism rejects scientific methodology. (Mcleod, 2015) This involves the use of diaries and open ended questions. Mother Theresa would have been asked to make a journal of her personal thoughts and would have been asked questions concerning her father’s death and her mother’s devotion to religious views.<br />
The four adjustment issues that Mother Theresa could have faced are as follows: stress from the initial stage of her ministry from having to beg for money and supplies in order to fulfill her ministry’s needs, frustration in the latter part of her life from feeling like God had abandoned her, according to her letters, conflict in the world from where she was criticized for her anti-abortion views (Biography.com Editors, 2018), and decision making through the issue of self-image when she was a girl and taking vows towards sisterhood. Mother Theresa overcame many of these conflicts, from the view of a humanist, through the drive to self-actualize and to express the unique individuality in her personal calling from God to overcome her obstacles. Social learning theory would express the idea that the decision making of her choice to become a nun was through the experience of having witnessed the religious devotion of her parents.<br />
Mother Theresa’s life was filled with self-sacrifice and devotion to the poorest of the poor in India. As a result of this, she was recognized and made a saint in the church only two years after her death. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Mother Theresa would make an excellent subject of explanation of her life through the lens of humanism. She fits the mold of the humanist’s view that humans are essentially good and have personal agency. Social learning theory however, is limited in the case of Mother Theresa because of the lack of detailed information regarding her young childhood.</p>
