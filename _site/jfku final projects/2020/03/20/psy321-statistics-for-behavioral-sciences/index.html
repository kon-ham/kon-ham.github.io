<meta name="description" content="Introduction Hypothesis 1: Students that have lower GPAs (Less than 3.0) tend to spend more than 10 hours a week on social media. Hypothesis 2: Students that say that they use social media during class tend to have GPAs lower than a 3.0. Probability question: If a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0? For the first hypothesis, it would appear that there is a relationship between a GPA of less than 3.0 and spending more than 10 hours a week on social media. Of the 25 students, 12 of the students were found to have less than a 3.0 GPA and having spent more than 10 hours a week on social media. This was a rate of 48%. In the second hypothesis, the data regarding the amount of students that say they use social media during classroom time and having less than a 3.0 GPA was found that 7 of the 25 students met this criterion at a rate of 28%. Finally, the based on the data for probability, only 3 of the 25 students were found to have met the criteria of having spent less than 20 hours a week and having a GPA higher than a 3.0 at a sample rate of 12%. The initial impressions of this probability seem low in general – there does not appear to be a strong relationship between academia and low social media usage. Perhaps it’s a generational issue and time spent wasted elsewhere is instead for these students spent mostly just on social media. Results GPA, right skew (Std. Deviation @ .58332): (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx) GPA is mostly centered around slightly less than 3.0, while the right skew implies that the 2nd majority of students are somewhere in between the range of 3.2 to 3.6 GPA. Number of close friends, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 5.1951): (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx) The majority of students have anywhere from 0-4 friends or 5-9 friends, making this a heavily left leaning skew. What is interesting to note here is that there is only one student of twenty five that mentioned having friends of 20-24. Number of school activities, right skew (Std. Deviation @ 2.138) (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx) The majority of students were found to have 4-5 school activities making this chart a right leaning skew. Average number of hours spent on social media each week, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 27.343006): (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx) Confidence interval of the first variable, GPA, is a population mean between 2.76 and 3.22. Confidence interval of the second variable, the amount of time spent on social media, is populations mean that is between 28.1 and 49.5. Based upon the original probability assumption made, that is, “if a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0?”, we can conclude safely that this chance of occurrence is actually very low due to the sampling given. There are not enough students that have a high GPA with less than 20 hours of social media a week and there are too many students that have a high GPA, that is, greater than a 3.0 that also spend much more than 20 hours a week on social media. This probability at around 12%, means that probably the secondary hypothesis ought to be rejected in the first place. Discussion Although the original hypothesis was designed to predict GPA scores and social media usage, specifically that social media usage was and low GPA was positively correlated, however the data supposes that there is no relationship between these two factors. In fact, there were many more evidences of data that conclude that many students are able to manage social media usage and to maintain a GPA greater than a 3.0, even for students that have claimed to have used social media while in the classroom. Based upon this study, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that social media has a negative effect upon GPA. This study concludes that because there is no evidence to suggest that social media has a negative effect upon GPAs, it should be allowed for the students to have access to social media during certain points of the day. However, the matter of whether or not the platform by which the social media is accessed, for example, a cellphone is a distraction for students is another data point which ought to be surveyed.

  <p>Introduction<br />
Hypothesis 1: Students that have lower GPAs (Less than 3.0) tend to spend more than 10 hours a week on social media.<br />
Hypothesis 2: Students that say that they use social media during class tend to have GPAs lower than a 3.0.<br />
Probability question: If a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0?<br />
For the first hypothesis, it would appear that there is a relationship between a GPA of less than 3.0 and spending more than 10 hours a week on social media. Of the 25 students, 12 of the students were found to have less than a 3.0 GPA and having spent more than 10 hours a week on social media. This was a rate of 48%.<br />
In the second hypothesis, the data regarding the amount of students that say they use social media during classroom time and having less than a 3.0 GPA was found that 7 of the 25 students met this criterion at a rate of 28%.<br />
Finally, the based on the data for probability, only 3 of the 25 students were found to have met the criteria of having spent less than 20 hours a week and having a GPA higher than a 3.0 at a sample rate of 12%. The initial impressions of this probability seem low in general – there does not appear to be a strong relationship between academia and low social media usage. Perhaps it’s a generational issue and time spent wasted elsewhere is instead for these students spent mostly just on social media.</p>

GPA, right skew (Std. Deviation @ .58332):<br />

GPA is mostly centered around slightly less than 3.0, while the right skew implies that the 2nd majority of students are somewhere in between the range of 3.2 to 3.6 GPA.<br />
Number of close friends, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 5.1951):<br />
(http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)<br />
The majority of students have anywhere from 0-4 friends or 5-9 friends, making this a heavily left leaning skew. What is interesting to note here is that there is only one student of twenty five that mentioned having friends of 20-24.<br />
Number of school activities, right skew (Std. Deviation @ 2.138) (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)<br />
The majority of students were found to have 4-5 school activities making this chart a right leaning skew.<br />
Average number of hours spent on social media each week, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 27.343006): (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)<br />
Confidence interval of the first variable, GPA, is a population mean between 2.76 and 3.22.<br />
Confidence interval of the second variable, the amount of time spent on social media, is populations mean that is between 28.1 and 49.5.<br />
Based upon the original probability assumption made, that is, “if a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0?”, we can conclude safely that this chance of occurrence is actually very low due to the sampling given.

This probability at around 12%, means that probably the secondary hypothesis ought to be rejected in the first place.</p>

<p>Discussion<br />
Although the original hypothesis was designed to predict GPA scores and social media usage, specifically that social media usage was and low GPA was positively correlated, however the data supposes that there is no relationship between these two factors. In fact, there were many more evidences of data that conclude that many students are able to manage social media usage and to maintain a GPA greater than a 3.0, even for students that have claimed to have used social media while in the classroom.
