<meta name="description" content="Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects over 51 million people worldwide. (Getz, 2014) Many of those affected with schizophrenia have auditory hallucinations, paranoia, significant social dysfunction, and cognitive decline. (Getz, 2014) There is no cure for this mental illness. Furthermore, this mental illness seems to be genetic in its causes, with one’s chance of being 1% in the general population compared to 10% if you’ve had a first-degree relative that’s also had schizophrenia. (Psychology Today, 2018) Although its exact causes are unknown, researchers now know that the neurotransmitters, specifically the ones associated with the dopamine and glutamate receptors, are correlated with those that have schizophrenia. (Psychology Today, 2018) Medication through the use of anti-psychotics is a common treatment for those with schizophrenia. Although the treatment of schizophrenia through the use of anti-psychotics does not cure schizophrenia, much of the positive symptoms of the illness, like the reduction of psychotic episodes, can be reduced drastically. However, this is not case with all that have schizophrenia, as some do not experience a reduction in the psychotic episodes. (Psychology Today, 2018) Schizophrenia is a serious disorder and affects many people worldwide. Therefore, it is the central topic for this discussion in order to more fully understand schizophrenia in terms of diagnosis, symptoms, causes, and treatment. Part I There are two types of symptoms of schizophrenia: positive and negative. The positive symptoms are probably the best well known to the public and includes hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. (Getz, 2014) Although these positive symptoms may appear to be the same in nature, they are in fact very different. Hallucination refers to the distortion or inaccuracy of sensory experiences. (Getz, 2014) This distortion or inaccuracy of the sensory experience is what causes someone experiencing them to believe the hallucinations to be true. Although one could experience these hallucinations in any kind of manner, auditory appears to be the most common distortion. (Getz, 2014) Delusions are “the fixed false beliefs that are resistant to reason or actual fact.” (Getz, 2014) This can be through feelings of grandeur, feelings of being persecuted, and erotomania, or excessive sexual desire. (Getz, 2014) Paranoia is the feeling that someone is out to get oneself. (Getz, 2014) This manifests in strange behavior that results in engaging in behavior to avoid being caught. (Getz, 2014) And although these symptoms seem the strangest of the schizophrenia mental illness, they are usually most easily treated through the use of anti-psychotics. (Getz, 2014) Negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be: “anhedonia, flat effect, thought poverty, and social withdrawal.” (Getz, 2014) Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. The flat effect has to do with the persons having no expression as they speak, or lack of facial movement, and a monotonous voice. (Getz, 2014) Thought poverty has to do with the reduction in the quantity of thoughts with those affected with schizophrenia. Social withdrawal may occur as a result of the mixture the symptoms of the symptoms of schizophrenia that one experiences as well as the inability of those that don’t have schizophrenia to understand in an empathetic manner how it is when one experiences auditory hallucinations or feelings of paranoia. Part II The brain relies upon the neurons firing correctly in order all four major parts of the brain to function correctly. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) These neurons send electrical messages through neurotransmitters. There are two specific neurotransmitters that are associated with schizophrenia – the glutamate receptor and the dopamine receptor. Dopamine is found in the basal ganglia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) This is in the lower part of the cerebrum. Specifically, the pathways of dopamine in the brain are, (1) nigrostriatal, (2) mesolimbic, (3) mesocortical, (4) and the tuberohypophyseal. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) The second, glutamate, is found nearly everywhere on the body. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) This receptor deals with the excitation of the nerves. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Finally, further development in brain scanning technology has led to a few interesting features of schizophrenics relating to the brain. Computerized tomography scans have revealed that there is a widening of the cortical sulci. (Lewis, 2015) Furthermore, schizophrenics tend to have enlarged ventricles in the brain. (Lewis, 2015) Patients with schizophrenia also tended to have approximately 5% less volume of the neocortex and “specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices.” (Lewis, 2015) Continuing, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that there is a decreased volume in the limbic system, especially for the hippocampus. Part III At the moment the cause of schizophrenia is pointing towards a biological cause. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) It is known that one’s chances of having schizophrenia is much higher when one has a close relative that also had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Another possible cause of schizophrenia is obstetrics. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Many studies have shown that many of those with schizophrenia have had mothers with complications from birth. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) A 1957 flu epidemic revealed that mothers infected with the flu during the second month of their pregnancy were double the chance of giving birth to a child with schizophrenia. Another aspect could be marijuana use, which scientists currently are undergoing research to discover the connection more clearly. As far as the issue of nature vs. nurture goes concerning schizophrenia, the exact causes are still yet unknown. Researchers have clues which may lead one to believe that schizophrenia is absolutely biological in its cause but the results are still inconclusive; it is reasonable at this point, given the amount of research and variety involved in the total number of factors relating to schizophrenia that do not provide conclusive evidence, to assume that for now, both the environment and genetic factors are involved. Part IV There is no single test that can diagnose schizophrenic. (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2018) Furthermore, other diagnoses must be ruled out to ensure that the patient has schizophrenia rather than bi-polar disorder or severe depression, all of which can convey similar symptoms to schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) To specifically be diagnosed with schizophrenia, “there must be at least six months of some negative and/or positive symptoms. In addition, within those six months, there must be at least one month of positive symptoms or negative symptoms for most of a month.” (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) According to the DSM-IV the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are six points; first, two or more characteristic symptoms for the duration of a substantial portion of one month, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms. (Lewis, 2015) Second, social/occupational dysfunction. Third, continuous signs of disturbance persist for at least six months, with one month of the first points of the criteria. (Lewis, 2015) Fourth, schizoaffective and mood disorder exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Fifth, substance and general medical condition exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Finally, a relationship to a pervasive development disorder. All of these symptoms and criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia are psychiatric. Because there is no known cause for the basis of schizophrenia, there are not yet complete tests created to diagnose schizophrenia, for example, through a blood test or a simple magnetic resonance imagining examination. Part V Buck is a man that was diagnosed with schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) He feels that he is not able to do as much as he did before he was sick. He still feels some sense of depression from his diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he notes that when he sees his daughter he feels there is hope in the world. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Joseph was 18 when he discovered he had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) He had symptoms of paranoia in that he thought the FBI was following him. It got worse until he felt he needed to check into a hospital. There he attempted to commit suicide. After speaking with other patients, he begins to feel that he that his own life was not as bad in comparison. After being discharged from the hospital he attempted a year without seeking help. He assumes that there was probably some shame in the fact that he was schizophrenic. Now he attends college, holds a steady relationship, and has daily structure in his life. There are numerous stories of patients and their diagnosis with schizophrenia, but the important aspect that these patients seem to be reaching is a sense of acceptance that they have schizophrenia, which requires an adaptation of life to work around the disorder. Treatment The first treatment is medication. Specifically, the type of medication used is commonly known as a conventional antipsychotic. (Lewis, 2015) They are all similar in that they are dopamine receptor antagonists. (Lewis, 2015) They are to be taken orally or to be injected. (Lewis, 2015) This medication is predicated off the belief that schizophrenia occurs as a result of hypersensitive dopamine receptors, or “an excess of dopaminergic activity.” (Lewis, 2015) Studies have found that patients with psychotic symptoms have also had an increase of dopamine release during a period of psychosis. (Lewis, 2015) However because of the decrease in overall dopamine production provided by the medication, patients can experience negative side-effects of the medication known as extrapyramidal symptoms. (Getz, 2014) Extrapyramidal symptoms usually involve symptoms such as “tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement), parkinsonism, akithesia, and dystonia.” (Getz, 2014) These extrapyramidal symptoms occur as a natural side effect of a reduction of dopamine production but specifically a reduction of dopamine receptors or dopamine blockage in the basal ganglia part of the brain. There are many different types of dopamine antagonist medications but recent studies have found that there is very little difference in the overall efficacy of the newer medication over the older medication. (Getz, 2014) Furthermore, newer medication has been shown to have an increased side-effect of weight gain with an increased chance of diabetes as well as being nearly 10 times more in cost. (Getz, 2014) Therefore prescribing of the dopamine antagonist medication must be, according to a $42.6-million study known as the “Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness” that though the medications that reduce dopamine receptors are similar in effectiveness overall, that the individual patient be considered in the prescription of a specific type. (Getz, 2014) The two benefits to medication are first, the decrease in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. (Lewis, 2015) The second is the relative ease of use concerning medication, which can be taken orally. Two negatives to medication are first, the medication only reduces positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The medication cannot reduce negative symptoms or cognitive disabilities relating to schizophrenia. And second, because the medication is to be taken on a regimen, or a schedule, there is a now a burden of responsibility on the patient and the caregiver to ensure that the patient receives the medication according to schedule. In summary, I would personally recommend the use of medication to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is not only my own opinion but of the opinions supported by general research that medication, as of now, is the only known treatment for the reduction of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In certain cases, medication, particularly dopamine antagonists, have been found to be ineffective for some with schizophrenia. However, the use of such medication is usually attempted and can be successful in the reduction of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia if followed correctly according to the regimen. I would completely recommend this form of intervention. Another form of treatment is known as the psychosocial form of treatment, or psychotherapy. Although medication can diminish or greatly lower the frequency of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, patients are still learning to recover from this disorder from the damage that was done socially – the relationships that were strained and perhaps lost from the onset of the symptoms of schizophrenia and from the loss of quality of life. These are problems that medication itself cannot fix. Psychotherapies such as cognitive remediation therapy is a form of psychotherapy that is focused on helping people to “adjust their goals and expectations to match their own abilities and skills.” (Getz, 2014) Continuing, “…Making such adjustments requires an objective understanding of own’s own cognitive strengths and weaknesses.” (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation therapy has shown to be beneficial in the improvement of social and cognitive function. (Getz, 2014) Specifically, cognitive remediation therapy applies the therapy in a clinical setting where positive reinforcements and scaffolding is applied. (Getz, 2014) This method has shown improvement in the cognitive function in just over six months’ time. (Getz, 2014) Another form of psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, like cognitive remediation therapy, has shown through trials that significant improvement in can be made through these methods, with cognitive behavioral therapy showing the same effect of that of clozapine in “four large, independent, randomized controlled trials”. (Lewis, 2015) Cognitive behavioral therapy has two elements which are, like cognitive remediation therapy, performed in a clinical setting. The first element is the cognition element, which involves “identifying links between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, identifying automatic thoughts, hypothesis testing about abnormal beliefs; reframing attributions, and identifying and enhancing coping strategies.” (Lewis, 2015) The behavioral element involves “symptom monitoring; the use of a diary, distraction techniques; focusing strategies for ‘voices’, graded task assignment, and anxiety management and relation techniques.” (Lewis, 2015) Psychotherapy does not affect the neurotransmitters specifically. However, MRI studies indicate that brain activity in specific areas relating to schizophrenia have increased as a result of psychotherapy. (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation and cognitive behavioral therapy both focus on coping mechanisms and the means to continue on with one’s life after one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The two benefits from psychotherapy is first, psychotherapy provides for a means to continue on with one’s own social life and professional work life through learning to cope with the disorder. Medication greatly reduces the number of symptoms that schizophrenia exhibits but now one must learn to cope with this disorder, which psychotherapy supports. Second, psychotherapy in conjunction with medication can greatly improve the chance of success. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown that it can reduce relapse risk by 50%. (Lewis, 2015) Two negatives to psychotherapy is first the lack of overwhelming evidence of success similar to the documentation available on the effectiveness of dopamine antagonist medications. And because cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive remediation therapy is not standardized, there is a challenge presented in the documentation and standardization of practice, since usually such therapy is individualized to suit the patient’s various needs. Second, as of now, medication is the only one known effective method of treatment. Psychotherapy is only as effective as the patient’s ability to maintain a schedule and to consistently attend therapy sessions. Based on the information presented above, I would also recommend psychotherapy with the specific clause that it only be recommended after the use of medication is prescribed. This author holds the opinion that medication with the use of psychotherapy can provide for some, perhaps most, and one day all, another chance at a normal life. References Getz, G. (2014).

(Psychology Today, 2018) Although its exact causes are unknown, researchers now know that the neurotransmitters, specifically the ones associated with the dopamine and glutamate receptors, are correlated with those that have schizophrenia. (Psychology Today, 2018) Medication through the use of anti-psychotics is a common treatment for those with schizophrenia. Although the treatment of schizophrenia through the use of anti-psychotics does not cure schizophrenia, much of the positive symptoms of the illness, like the reduction of psychotic episodes, can be reduced drastically. However, this is not case with all that have schizophrenia, as some do not experience a reduction in the psychotic episodes. (Psychology Today, 2018) Schizophrenia is a serious disorder and affects many people worldwide. Therefore, it is the central topic for this discussion in order to more fully understand schizophrenia in terms of diagnosis, symptoms, causes, and treatment. Part I There are two types of symptoms of schizophrenia: positive and negative. The positive symptoms are probably the best well known to the public and includes hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. (Getz, 2014) Although these positive symptoms may appear to be the same in nature, they are in fact very different. Hallucination refers to the distortion or inaccuracy of sensory experiences. (Getz, 2014) This distortion or inaccuracy of the sensory experience is what causes someone experiencing them to believe the hallucinations to be true. Although one could experience these hallucinations in any kind of manner, auditory appears to be the most common distortion. (Getz, 2014) Delusions are “the fixed false beliefs that are resistant to reason or actual fact.” (Getz, 2014) This can be through feelings of grandeur, feelings of being persecuted, and erotomania, or excessive sexual desire. (Getz, 2014) Paranoia is the feeling that someone is out to get oneself. (Getz, 2014) This manifests in strange behavior that results in engaging in behavior to avoid being caught. (Getz, 2014) And although these symptoms seem the strangest of the schizophrenia mental illness, they are usually most easily treated through the use of anti-psychotics. (Getz, 2014) Negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be: “anhedonia, flat effect, thought poverty, and social withdrawal.” (Getz, 2014) Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. The flat effect has to do with the persons having no expression as they speak, or lack of facial movement, and a monotonous voice. (Getz, 2014) Thought poverty has to do with the reduction in the quantity of thoughts with those affected with schizophrenia. Social withdrawal may occur as a result of the mixture the symptoms of the symptoms of schizophrenia that one experiences as well as the inability of those that don’t have schizophrenia to understand in an empathetic manner how it is when one experiences auditory hallucinations or feelings of paranoia. Part II The brain relies upon the neurons firing correctly in order all four major parts of the brain to function correctly. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) These neurons send electrical messages through neurotransmitters. There are two specific neurotransmitters that are associated with schizophrenia – the glutamate receptor and the dopamine receptor. Dopamine is found in the basal ganglia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) This is in the lower part of the cerebrum. Specifically, the pathways of dopamine in the brain are, (1) nigrostriatal, (2) mesolimbic, (3) mesocortical, (4) and the tuberohypophyseal. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) The second, glutamate, is found nearly everywhere on the body. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) This receptor deals with the excitation of the nerves. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Finally, further development in brain scanning technology has led to a few interesting features of schizophrenics relating to the brain. Computerized tomography scans have revealed that there is a widening of the cortical sulci. (Lewis, 2015) Furthermore, schizophrenics tend to have enlarged ventricles in the brain. (Lewis, 2015) Patients with schizophrenia also tended to have approximately 5% less volume of the neocortex and “specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices.” (Lewis, 2015) Continuing, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that there is a decreased volume in the limbic system, especially for the hippocampus. Part III At the moment the cause of schizophrenia is pointing towards a biological cause. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) It is known that one’s chances of having schizophrenia is much higher when one has a close relative that also had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Another possible cause of schizophrenia is obstetrics. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Many studies have shown that many of those with schizophrenia have had mothers with complications from birth. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) A 1957 flu epidemic revealed that mothers infected with the flu during the second month of their pregnancy were double the chance of giving birth to a child with schizophrenia. Another aspect could be marijuana use, which scientists currently are undergoing research to discover the connection more clearly. As far as the issue of nature vs. nurture goes concerning schizophrenia, the exact causes are still yet unknown. Researchers have clues which may lead one to believe that schizophrenia is absolutely biological in its cause but the results are still inconclusive; it is reasonable at this point, given the amount of research and variety involved in the total number of factors relating to schizophrenia that do not provide conclusive evidence, to assume that for now, both the environment and genetic factors are involved. Part IV There is no single test that can diagnose schizophrenic. (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2018) Furthermore, other diagnoses must be ruled out to ensure that the patient has schizophrenia rather than bi-polar disorder or severe depression, all of which can convey similar symptoms to schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) To specifically be diagnosed with schizophrenia, “there must be at least six months of some negative and/or positive symptoms. In addition, within those six months, there must be at least one month of positive symptoms or negative symptoms for most of a month.” (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) According to the DSM-IV the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are six points; first, two or more characteristic symptoms for the duration of a substantial portion of one month, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms. (Lewis, 2015) Second, social/occupational dysfunction. Third, continuous signs of disturbance persist for at least six months, with one month of the first points of the criteria. (Lewis, 2015) Fourth, schizoaffective and mood disorder exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Fifth, substance and general medical condition exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Finally, a relationship to a pervasive development disorder. All of these symptoms and criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia are psychiatric. Because there is no known cause for the basis of schizophrenia, there are not yet complete tests created to diagnose schizophrenia, for example, through a blood test or a simple magnetic resonance imagining examination. Part V Buck is a man that was diagnosed with schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) He feels that he is not able to do as much as he did before he was sick. He still feels some sense of depression from his diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he notes that when he sees his daughter he feels there is hope in the world. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) Joseph was 18 when he discovered he had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp; Mason, 2002) He had symptoms of paranoia in that he thought the FBI was following him. It got worse until he felt he needed to check into a hospital. There he attempted to commit suicide. After speaking with other patients, he begins to feel that he that his own life was not as bad in comparison. After being discharged from the hospital he attempted a year without seeking help. He assumes that there was probably some shame in the fact that he was schizophrenic. Now he attends college, holds a steady relationship, and has daily structure in his life. There are numerous stories of patients and their diagnosis with schizophrenia, but the important aspect that these patients seem to be reaching is a sense of acceptance that they have schizophrenia, which requires an adaptation of life to work around the disorder. Treatment The first treatment is medication. Specifically, the type of medication used is commonly known as a conventional antipsychotic. (Lewis, 2015) They are all similar in that they are dopamine receptor antagonists. (Lewis, 2015) They are to be taken orally or to be injected. (Lewis, 2015) This medication is predicated off the belief that schizophrenia occurs as a result of hypersensitive dopamine receptors, or “an excess of dopaminergic activity.” (Lewis, 2015) Studies have found that patients with psychotic symptoms have also had an increase of dopamine release during a period of psychosis. (Lewis, 2015) However because of the decrease in overall dopamine production provided by the medication, patients can experience negative side-effects of the medication known as extrapyramidal symptoms. (Getz, 2014) Extrapyramidal symptoms usually involve symptoms such as “tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement), parkinsonism, akithesia, and dystonia.” (Getz, 2014) These extrapyramidal symptoms occur as a natural side effect of a reduction of dopamine production but specifically a reduction of dopamine receptors or dopamine blockage in the basal ganglia part of the brain. There are many different types of dopamine antagonist medications but recent studies have found that there is very little difference in the overall efficacy of the newer medication over the older medication. (Getz, 2014) Furthermore, newer medication has been shown to have an increased side-effect of weight gain with an increased chance of diabetes as well as being nearly 10 times more in cost. (Getz, 2014) Therefore prescribing of the dopamine antagonist medication must be, according to a $42.6-million study known as the “Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness” that though the medications that reduce dopamine receptors are similar in effectiveness overall, that the individual patient be considered in the prescription of a specific type. (Getz, 2014) The two benefits to medication are first, the decrease in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. (Lewis, 2015) The second is the relative ease of use concerning medication, which can be taken orally. Two negatives to medication are first, the medication only reduces positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The medication cannot reduce negative symptoms or cognitive disabilities relating to schizophrenia. And second, because the medication is to be taken on a regimen, or a schedule, there is a now a burden of responsibility on the patient and the caregiver to ensure that the patient receives the medication according to schedule. In summary, I would personally recommend the use of medication to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is not only my own opinion but of the opinions supported by general research that medication, as of now, is the only known treatment for the reduction of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In certain cases, medication, particularly dopamine antagonists, have been found to be ineffective for some with schizophrenia. However, the use of such medication is usually attempted and can be successful in the reduction of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia if followed correctly according to the regimen. I would completely recommend this form of intervention. Another form of treatment is known as the psychosocial form of treatment, or psychotherapy. Although medication can diminish or greatly lower the frequency of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, patients are still learning to recover from this disorder from the damage that was done socially – the relationships that were strained and perhaps lost from the onset of the symptoms of schizophrenia and from the loss of quality of life. These are problems that medication itself cannot fix. Psychotherapies such as cognitive remediation therapy is a form of psychotherapy that is focused on helping people to “adjust their goals and expectations to match their own abilities and skills.” (Getz, 2014) Continuing, “…Making such adjustments requires an objective understanding of own’s own cognitive strengths and weaknesses.” (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation therapy has shown to be beneficial in the improvement of social and cognitive function. (Getz, 2014) Specifically, cognitive remediation therapy applies the therapy in a clinical setting where positive reinforcements and scaffolding is applied. (Getz, 2014) This method has shown improvement in the cognitive function in just over six months’ time. (Getz, 2014) Another form of psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, like cognitive remediation therapy, has shown through trials that significant improvement in can be made through these methods, with cognitive behavioral therapy showing the same effect of that of clozapine in “four large, independent, randomized controlled trials”. (Lewis, 2015) Cognitive behavioral therapy has two elements which are, like cognitive remediation therapy, performed in a clinical setting. The first element is the cognition element, which involves “identifying links between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, identifying automatic thoughts, hypothesis testing about abnormal beliefs; reframing attributions, and identifying and enhancing coping strategies.” (Lewis, 2015) The behavioral element involves “symptom monitoring; the use of a diary, distraction techniques; focusing strategies for ‘voices’, graded task assignment, and anxiety management and relation techniques.” (Lewis, 2015) Psychotherapy does not affect the neurotransmitters specifically. However, MRI studies indicate that brain activity in specific areas relating to schizophrenia have increased as a result of psychotherapy. (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation and cognitive behavioral therapy both focus on coping mechanisms and the means to continue on with one’s life after one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The two benefits from psychotherapy is first, psychotherapy provides for a means to continue on with one’s own social life and professional work life through learning to cope with the disorder. Medication greatly reduces the number of symptoms that schizophrenia exhibits but now one must learn to cope with this disorder, which psychotherapy supports. Second, psychotherapy in conjunction with medication can greatly improve the chance of success. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown that it can reduce relapse risk by 50%. (Lewis, 2015) Two negatives to psychotherapy is first the lack of overwhelming evidence of success similar to the documentation available on the effectiveness of dopamine antagonist medications. And because cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive remediation therapy is not standardized, there is a challenge presented in the documentation and standardization of practice, since usually such therapy is individualized to suit the patient’s various needs. Second, as of now, medication is the only one known effective method of treatment. Psychotherapy is only as effective as the patient’s ability to maintain a schedule and to consistently attend therapy sessions. Based on the information presented above, I would also recommend psychotherapy with the specific clause that it only be recommended after the use of medication is prescribed. This author holds the opinion that medication with the use of psychotherapy can provide for some, perhaps most, and one day all, another chance at a normal life. References Getz, G. (2014).

  <p>Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects over 51 million people worldwide. (Getz, 2014) Many of those affected with schizophrenia have auditory hallucinations, paranoia, significant social dysfunction, and cognitive decline. (Getz, 2014) There is no cure for this mental illness. Furthermore, this mental illness seems to be genetic in its causes, with one’s chance of being 1% in the general population compared to 10% if you’ve had a first-degree relative that’s also had schizophrenia.

Therefore, it is the central topic for this discussion in order to more fully understand schizophrenia in terms of diagnosis, symptoms, causes, and treatment.<br />
Part I<br />
There are two types of symptoms of schizophrenia: positive and negative. The positive symptoms are probably the best well known to the public and includes hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. (Getz, 2014) Although these positive symptoms may appear to be the same in nature, they are in fact very different. Hallucination refers to the distortion or inaccuracy of sensory experiences.

Although one could experience these hallucinations in any kind of manner, auditory appears to be the most common distortion. (Getz, 2014) Delusions are “the fixed false beliefs that are resistant to reason or actual fact.” (Getz, 2014) This can be through feelings of grandeur, feelings of being persecuted, and erotomania, or excessive sexual desire. (Getz, 2014) Paranoia is the feeling that someone is out to get oneself. (Getz, 2014) This manifests in strange behavior that results in engaging in behavior to avoid being caught. (Getz, 2014) And although these symptoms seem the strangest of the schizophrenia mental illness, they are usually most easily treated through the use of anti-psychotics. (Getz, 2014) Negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be: “anhedonia, flat effect, thought poverty, and social withdrawal.” (Getz, 2014) Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. The flat effect has to do with the persons having no expression as they speak, or lack of facial movement, and a monotonous voice. (Getz, 2014) Thought poverty has to do with the reduction in the quantity of thoughts with those affected with schizophrenia. Social withdrawal may occur as a result of the mixture the symptoms of the symptoms of schizophrenia that one experiences as well as the inability of those that don’t have schizophrenia to understand in an empathetic manner how it is when one experiences auditory hallucinations or feelings of paranoia.<br />

The two benefits to medication are first, the decrease in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
