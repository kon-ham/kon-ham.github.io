  <time datetime="2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00" class="post-date">20 Mar 2020</time>
  <p>Netflix is a company founded by Reed Hastings in 1999. The company originally<br />
started with a mail-by-order DVD rental service. (“How Netflix got started”, 2009)<br />
Although Netflix still provides this service, it is possibly most well known for delivering<br />
entertainment content through the internet. This service is called “streaming” and<br />
involves consumers being able to instantly view content with the ability to pause, rewind,<br />
and fast forward video or audio. This streaming service is made possible with internet<br />
access and differs from conventional television in that the user decides what program to<br />
view.</p>

<p>Although Netflix continues to provide DVD rental services as well as producing<br />
new entertainment content to provide consumers, I have decided to choose this streaming<br />
service as the point of research for this project because of the popularity of Netflix’s<br />
streaming service.</p>

<p>The following are the three determinants of demand for Netflix’s streaming<br />
service: First, price of the subscription service. Netflix currently charges $9.99 for its HD<br />
service and $7.99 for its regular service. One reason for price being a large determinant<br />
of demand was the controversy of Netflix’s streaming service being raised $1.00. And as<br />
a result of the second determinant of demand, consumer expectations, Netflix struggled<br />
against consumer backlash with the increase of price. Although backlash was imminent,<br />
so were the increases. But the increases in price don’t seem to have reduced the overall<br />
number of subscriptions of customers. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016) Finally, the third<br />
determinant of demand is consumer taste. Consumers tend to have preferences for the<br />
shows they watch or types of genres they prefer.</p>

<p>Competitors of Netflix have capitalized<br />
on this and have created streaming services to cater specifically to consumers who have<br />
desires in specific niche markets, like, for example, Bloomberg’s streaming service<br />
catered directly to those interested in business affairs. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016)<br />
According to the previous determinants of demand, the streaming of service of<br />
Netflix appears to be an inelastic demand. The number of subscribers has actually<br />
increased despite the increase in price. (“The Impact Of Netflix’s”, 2014) And part of this<br />
may have less to do with price and more to do with consumer expectations as well as<br />
consumer taste. Netflix has been increasingly producing its own content as a result of the<br />
higher prices content producers have been charging Netflix the rights to stream their<br />
content on Netflix’s platform. And as a result of this, Netflix has been producing content<br />
that has been exclusive to Netflix. Consumers now must decide if the exclusive content<br />
on Netflix is worth the increase in monthly price. And of course, it appears to be that<br />
consumers are happy with the content Netflix offers. And with the data collection that<br />
Netflix obsessively hoards and analyzes, Netflix creates more exclusive shows that<br />
appear to be irresistible to its monthly subscribers. (Bulygo, 2013) <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>

<p>(Pelisson, 2017)<br />
  The market structure of Netflix is most like a monopolistic competition. There are<br />
many firms which sell a service, in this case streaming, and that service cannot easily be<br />
differentiated between each firm. In this case, many of the movies and TV shows offered<br />
on one firm’s service are also offered on another firm’s service. But because of this lack<br />
of differentiation between the firms, these companies that offer streaming services now<br />
offer exclusive content that is featured only on each of the company’s services. Although<br />
the barriers to entry, in this case, consist of being in the millions of dollars, it is relatively<br />
easy for production companies to create their own streaming service. Hulu, for example,<br />
is a result of “a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company’s Disney/ABC TV<br />
Group, Twenty-First Century Fox’s Fox Broadcasting Company and Comcast’s NBC<br />
Universal Television Group”. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016) In this case here, the<br />
strategic alliance between these companies makes the creation of a streaming service and<br />
company a relatively low-cost option. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016)</p>

<p>And interestingly enough, Netflix draws from its massive source of analytics and<br />
data to create targeted advertisements to draw audiences into its original content shows.<br />
(Katai, 2017) This means that theoretically, it can draw in audiences into shows they<br />
would not originally have interest in, if the targeted advertisements could create a draw<br />
based upon the targeted person’s preference in sex, age, and interests.<br />
Netflix is slowly moving away from the monopolistic competition market<br />
structure due to the fact that Netflix is continually expanding its creation of original<br />
content. Had Netflix continued only to offer a streaming service as its sole source of<br />
revenue, competitors would have cut Netflix out of the market by creating its own direct<br />
streaming service. And furthermore, consumers would have a harder time differentiating<br />
between the firms and the services. But because Netflix produces exclusive content,<br />
consumers have an easier time differentiating between the firms but possibly a more<br />
difficult time choosing between the firms as a result of conflict of interests.</p>

<p>The three recommendations I would make to Netflix are this: First, while<br />
continuing to produce original content, increase the prices again. Offer excellent content<br />
and services in return for the higher price to justify to consumers that Netflix remains the<br />
undisputed champion in streaming services and content creation. And as Netflix<br />
continues down this direction, Netflix should move from streaming service as the<br />
delivery method and to focus entirely on content creation as the means to differentiate<br />
itself from its competitors. I justify this suggestion based upon the graph I’ve created<br />
above that suggests the price of Netflix is to a certain degree, inelastic. The recent price<br />
increases of Netflix, while vocally many consumers groaned against this increase, still<br />
did not cause enough of Netflix’s consumers to cancel their monthly subscription. And I<br />
believe this is a result of Netflix’s continuation to create original content. This content is<br />
exclusive to Netflix and cannot be streamed on other streaming platforms like Hulu.</p>

<p>If Netflix wanted additional revenue, I would also suggest the creation of<br />
supplementary products. One example would be the implementation of a social network<br />
interface to Netflix’s streaming service. In this service Netflix would allow for their<br />
customers to connect with each other – to share, to “like”, and to use Netflix as a medium<br />
to meet new people. This would be a totally unique service that would set Netflix apart<br />
completely. This is a great way to enter into alternative markets to take from people who<br />
would not ordinarily use Netflix for social media. And considering that Netflix is<br />
sometimes broadcasted on a TV, Netflix could also introduce a proprietary keyboard that<br />
works as a remote as well as a microphone device. There is not a platform that allows this<br />
service. It would take little investment to create a social-media element to this and would<br />
justify the higher cost of Netflix. There are many people in relationships that are<br />
currently separated due to job relocations and so on. Giving opportunities for couples to<br />
watch movies together and to communicate while the movie goes on gives Netflix the<br />
opportunity to offer emotional and sentimental value to the consumer. This is priceless in<br />
itself and customers would justify a $17.99 price if it meant that these consumers could<br />
keep in touch with loved ones.</p>

<p>Second, while producing original content, I would suggest to Netflix to offer a<br />
free subscription option to lure new customers into Netflix’s ecosystem. So this means<br />
that Netflix negotiates with advertisers to pay for content distribution to consumers while<br />
at the same time, Netflix continues to use the data analytics from the viewing habits of<br />
consumers to target specific ads related to Netflix’s original content; from there to then<br />
try to lure new consumers into purchasing Netflix’s “premium” access, which would be<br />
anywhere from $15.99 to $17.99. I suggest this based off of not only price demand<br />
determinant, but also tastes as a demand determinant. The higher price will most certainly<br />
be unpopular since Netflix originally started at a $7.99 monthly subscription. Customers<br />
have a luxury to compare that original price to my suggested new price: $15.99-17.99.<br />
That’s around a 125% increase in price. So naturally there would be controversy. But I<br />
believe that the creation of original content would change consumer demand would not<br />
change the consumer demand but would rather shift the entire demand curve to the right.<br />
In order to further finance these costs, I also suggest strategic alliances with<br />
production companies, especially newer production companies that are willing and<br />
desperate to breakthrough into the market. So, signing new production companies into a<br />
contract in which Netflix offers to stream the content in exchange for ad revenue and data<br />
collection from the streaming of the new production companies’ content. Streaming on<br />
the Netflix platform is sure to generate viewership so it works out for new production<br />
companies. Since Netflix is giving free traffic to these production companies, it costs<br />
Netflix only the bandwidth cost. That cost is offset by the revenue of the advertisements<br />
that will play on top of these breakthrough shows. And Netflix can create further assets<br />
through the data and analytics that are mined from the result of viewership that comes<br />
from the “free subscription” of Netflix. So it is a win-win situation for everyone,<br />
especially for those who feel they’ve not the ability to justify paying $17.99 in<br />
subscription costs.</p>

<p>So the free subscription is a matter of maintain strategic alliances between the<br />
production companies who don’t have the revenue to create their own streaming services<br />
and the advertising companies as well as the scouting of new production companies who<br />
are willing to sacrifice current revenue for viewership now. This can be an avenue for<br />
countless amounts of “indie” or independent content creators to find a wider viewership.<br />
This even means that these people no longer have to upload their content through<br />
YouTube and instead Netflix can take a portion of YouTube’s production community<br />
away from it and drive it instead to Netflix.</p>

<p>It is impossible to correctly predict future consumer tastes and preferences all of<br />
the time. That’s why investing in future production companies who are independent and<br />
usually don’t have the cash flow to create their own content streaming service would be<br />
beneficial to Netflix. Netflix can then take this data from the viewership of these smaller<br />
production companies and then turn around and create its own original content that can<br />
compete with these independent content creators. And with the higher cost of<br />
subscription, Netflix can then focus entirely on creating original content. Netflix must<br />
focs on content creation as a result of larger production companies like Disney, ABC and<br />
so on creating their own streaming services. This means that they are not likely to share<br />
content with Netflix, or will charge higher prices of access to Netflix because these large<br />
production firms are in competition with Netflix. They want to succeed over Netflix so<br />
there is no incentive for these companies to play along nicely with Netflix. If Netflix<br />
were to simply sink back to streaming as a service as their only source of revenue, it will<br />
fall into the monopolistic competition market structure and will eventually be forced out<br />
of the industry by price.</p>

<p>Finally, I suggest that Netflix not ignore the domestic market. There are still<br />
millions more Americans who do not have Netflix subscription access as a result of the<br />
technological divide. I suggest that Netflix create a device that plugs into a TV with<br />
RGB, VGA, and HDMI inputs. This allows for people who do not have access to internet<br />
streaming devices to plug into Netflix’s content environment. Now, since these people<br />
usually are not tech-savvy it would take a mailing campaign with a personalized letter as<br />
well as a detailed but simple “How-To” instructional on how to install the device and<br />
how to pay for the service. Even better would be a way to provide access to content<br />
without the use of internet – perhaps through a satellite connection. This same technology<br />
could be used to gain entry into the market of consumers who are international but<br />
without stable access to the internet. I believe that Netflix is expanding into the<br />
international market and as a result under appreciating the domestic market.</p>
