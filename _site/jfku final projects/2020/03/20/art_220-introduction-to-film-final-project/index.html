<meta name="description" content="We are introduced to the Corleone family through a wedding. It is the wedding of Connie Corleone, daughter of Vito Corleone. Vito Corleone is the Don, or head executive of the Corleone crime family. Through the wedding we are introduced to multiple family characters and associates of the family. We also see people entering into the office of Don Vito Corleone to make requests of him. It is a Sicilian tradition to fulfill requests on the day of his daughter’s wedding. Here we see the dynamic of the power that Don Corleone wields. All requests are fulfilled. We are also introduced to Michael Corleone. He is the son of Don Corleone. Michael Corleone was returned from the wars of World War II. He is a war hero. Audience members are shown his reluctance towards the Corleone’s criminal interests. We also see that Michael Corleone is favored by Don Corleone. When the family gathers together for a photo, Don Corleone disperses the crowd upon seeing that Michael is not present for the photo. We see various vices that the Corleone family members are involved in. Sonny has a temper problem and involves himself with other women besides his wife. Fredo Corleone was always weak and indecisive and a womanizer. We are also introduced to other family member associates, like Luca Brasi, an intimidating thug for the Corleone family, and Tom Hagen, an adopted German-Irish boy who grows up to be the lawyer and later consigliere for the Corleone family. The inciting incident occurs when Don Corleone’s presence is requested by Sollozzo, a rising drug baron. Sollozzo requests support for his drug business but Don Corleone refuses because Don Corleone considers the drug business to be bad business. After the meeting finishes, Don Corleone orders Luca Brasi to spy on the Tattaglia family. Luca goes to the Tattaglia family and is killed. Around the same time, Don Corleone is also gunned down in the streets. These events are all part of the rising action of the movie. The Climax of the movie occurs when Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey. This is because Sollozzo is still strong-arming the Corleone family, hoping to take advantage of the death of Luca and the hospitalization of Don Corleone. Sollozzo and McCluskey, a crooked police chief, meet Michael in order to broker the same deal that Corleone refused. Michael and the Corleone family use this opportunity to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey. At this point all of the crime families are at war. Michael is sent off to Sicily to hide until things begin to cool down. Here in Sicily Michael lives a quiet life and even affords to marry a beautiful Sicilian woman named Apollonia. However he cannot hide for long. A car bomb intended for Michael Corleone ends up killing Apollonia. His brother, Sonny, is also killed by the crime families. Don Corleone, having healed now calls for a peace between the families. Don Corleone agrees to provide support for the heroin business and to look aside avenging the death of his son. Michael is able now to return home from Sicily. Michael then takes the reigns of the Corleone family by becoming the Don. Vito Corleone, Michael’s father and the previous Don, steps aside and becomes the acting-consigliere. This is the falling action. Vito Corleone also suffers a fatal heart-attack while playing with Michael’s son in the family garden. Michael is now alone in the matters of the family business and takes control. Michael Corleone goes to assassin the other family dons and Michael cleans house within his own family, executing Tessio, the betrayer of the family interests and also orders the killing of Carlo, the husband of Connie and the man we discover that had set up Sonny be to killed in the streets. The denouement of the movie occurs when we see the capos address Michael Corleone as Don Corleone and as the door is closed on Kay, Michael’s wife. There is no doubt that the movie is of the Gangster genre. The plot, typical of gangster movies, involves the story of multiple men who find success in America through atypical and often illegal means and must struggle with the consequences of the actions of their crime-led lives. The movie gives us an interesting insight into the culture of the crime family. Brute force is done only after a polite request. After that request being denied, these people are “made an offer that they cannot refuse.” Although the movie was released in 1972, the movie takes place shortly after the end of World War II. The outfits, the cars, the general mood of the movie is nostalgic, and even the way the mobsters conduct themselves seems to be from another world, or perhaps “an old world”. Although the portrayal of the movie is set in the 1940s, when the movie was released in 1972 the Mafia was still a major player in the underground market for crime, leading to further fascination of the public concerning the Mafia. The previous decades saw the rise of communism, the assassination of Kennedy, the entry into Vietnam, Kent State as well as the Civil Rights movement. All over the country there was turmoil and unease concerning the government’s ability to maintain discipline and order. We are almost shocked to see how ruthless the crime families operate. But at the same time, we are in awe at how they conduct themselves. Amidst the killings and illegal activities, there is an old way of doing things. And the basis of that way of doing things, according to Don Corleone, is respect. And with that respect the Corleone and the other crime families operate from the highest position of Don to the capos and basic thugs. One can’t help but wonder – does the Mafia handle things more efficiently than our politicians? And if the politicians and police are hand in hand with the crime families, just how far does the corruption go? Can one still hold some form of faith in the powers that be? Furthermore, The Godfather was a land mark moment for the perceptions of the Italians. For years the Italians had been immigrating to the United States. And their presence in the country was not well appreciated at all. And apart from the movies that portrayed Italians as spaghetti and meatball eating “talk-a like-a dis-a”, The Godfather was one of the first movies that portrayed the structure of the Italian family to American audiences. Amidst the crime and killing, you are introduced to the family as humans. They are all people with problems and who just happen to be involved in crime as a way of surviving. Francis Ford Coppola was himself an Italian and Sicilian, so I think that portrayal of the Italian family in The Godfather was in many ways authentic to the experience of the immigrant experience as an Italian or Sicilian. And of course Francis Ford Coppola is considered one of a few key directors who were part of the New Hollywood movement. This new movement, led by a number of younger directors was the key to the revival of commercial success in film. Instead of the studio system where the studio held the majority sway on what happened in a film, the New Hollywood movement was instead based on the authority of the director. So while other film movements happened by choice, New Hollywood happened as a result of the growing of commercial television as well as the demise of the studio system. So the New Hollywood movement rather happened as a fact of necessity rather than be real “choice” of style, genre, or editing. And this new movement was commercially and artistically a major success for the studio groups and the directors. The Godfather is proof of this, having won major awards such as the Oscars for best picture and actor as well as generally being a financial success. Furthermore, The Godfather is considered one of the most influential films for the gangster genre. The film stands as a massive achievement of the New Hollywood movement as well as the talent of Francis Ford Coppola being more than adequately displayed in the film. Italian Americans also watched the movie and found comfort in the portrayal of the Italians are more than just thugs or gangsters. And they also found pride in that it was the Italians, who came from so far a country to a place where they were called racial slurs and told to go back home that created an empire that was to be feared by all who had an interest in real power – a sort of frightful respect." />

  <p>We are introduced to the Corleone family through a wedding. It is the wedding of Connie Corleone, daughter of Vito Corleone. Vito Corleone is the Don, or head executive of the Corleone crime family. Through the wedding we are introduced to multiple family characters and associates of the family. We also see people entering into the office of Don Vito Corleone to make requests of him. It is a Sicilian tradition to fulfill requests on the day of his daughter’s wedding. Here we see the dynamic of the power that Don Corleone wields. All requests are fulfilled.<br />
We are also introduced to Michael Corleone. He is the son of Don Corleone. Michael Corleone was returned from the wars of World War II. He is a war hero. Audience members are shown his reluctance towards the Corleone’s criminal interests. We also see that Michael Corleone is favored by Don Corleone. When the family gathers together for a photo, Don Corleone disperses the crowd upon seeing that Michael is not present for the photo.<br />
We see various vices that the Corleone family members are involved in. Sonny has a temper problem and involves himself with other women besides his wife. Fredo Corleone was always weak and indecisive and a womanizer. We are also introduced to other family member associates, like Luca Brasi, an intimidating thug for the Corleone family, and Tom Hagen, an adopted German-Irish boy who grows up to be the lawyer and later consigliere for the Corleone family.<br />
The inciting incident occurs when Don Corleone’s presence is requested by Sollozzo, a rising drug baron. Sollozzo requests support for his drug business but Don Corleone refuses because Don Corleone considers the drug business to be bad business. After the meeting finishes, Don Corleone orders Luca Brasi to spy on the Tattaglia family. Luca goes to the Tattaglia family and is killed. Around the same time, Don Corleone is also gunned down in the streets. These events are all part of the rising action of the movie.<br />
The Climax of the movie occurs when Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey.

Sollozzo and McCluskey, a crooked police chief, meet Michael in order to broker the same deal that Corleone refused. Michael and the Corleone family use this opportunity to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey. At this point all of the crime families are at war. Michael is sent off to Sicily to hide until things begin to cool down.<br />
Here in Sicily Michael lives a quiet life and even affords to marry a beautiful Sicilian woman named Apollonia. However he cannot hide for long. A car bomb intended for Michael Corleone ends up killing Apollonia. His brother, Sonny, is also killed by the crime families. Don Corleone, having healed now calls for a peace between the families. Don Corleone agrees to provide support for the heroin business and to look aside avenging the death of his son. Michael is able now to return home from Sicily.<br />
Michael then takes the reigns of the Corleone family by becoming the Don. Vito Corleone, Michael’s father and the previous Don, steps aside and becomes the acting-consigliere. This is the falling action. Vito Corleone also suffers a fatal heart-attack while playing with Michael’s son in the family garden. Michael is now alone in the matters of the family business and takes control. Michael Corleone goes to assassin the other family dons and Michael cleans house within his own family, executing Tessio, the betrayer of the family interests and also orders the killing of Carlo, the husband of Connie and the man we discover that had set up Sonny be to killed in the streets.<br />

Francis Ford Coppola was himself an Italian and Sicilian, so I think that portrayal of the Italian family in The Godfather was in many ways authentic to the experience of the immigrant experience as an Italian or Sicilian.<br />
And of course Francis Ford Coppola is considered one of a few key directors who were part of the New Hollywood movement. This new movement, led by a number of younger directors was the key to the revival of commercial success in film. Instead of the studio system where the studio held the majority sway on what happened in a film, the New Hollywood movement was instead based on the authority of the director. So while other film movements happened by choice, New Hollywood happened as a result of the growing of commercial television as well as the demise of the studio system. So the New Hollywood movement rather happened as a fact of necessity rather than be real “choice” of style, genre, or editing.<br />
And this new movement was commercially and artistically a major success for the studio groups and the directors. The Godfather is proof of this, having won major awards such as the Oscars for best picture and actor as well as generally being a financial success. Furthermore, The Godfather is considered one of the most influential films for the gangster genre. The film stands as a massive achievement of the New Hollywood movement as well as the talent of Francis Ford Coppola being more than adequately displayed in the film. Italian Americans also watched the movie and found comfort in the portrayal of the Italians are more than just thugs or gangsters. And they also found pride in that it was the Italians, who came from so far a country to a place where they were called racial slurs and told to go back home that created an empire that was to be feared by all who had an interest in real power – a sort of frightful respect.</p>
