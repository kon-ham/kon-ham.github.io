<meta name="description" content="Kon Ham EDU435 Introduction My name is Kon Ham, and I am most especially honored and pleased to be a part of your team. Please allow me to describe my professional background. My parents are small business owners. Most career business owners will understand – you’ve got to lose a few businesses before you win it big. I’ve personally witnessed my parents losing more than their share of businesses as a result of their own mistakes and failures. I’ve also seen them profit greatly as a result of proper management and unrelenting passion and vision. So, I have been close if not a mere witness to the ups and downs of business. I’ve also helped to manage those businesses. My background in the management of this business is that I have always been close to the source of the business – that is, the customer. Usually in the line of work my parents are involved in, the manager is also the front clerk. Therefore, the front clerk is where the manager makes the most of his or her experience being nearest to the business. After sometime of this, I impulsively left the family business and joined a military branch – The United States Coast Guard. In the United States Coast Guard, I learned to work consistently under pressure. From boot camp to petty officer indoctrination school, or in business terms mid-level manager school and work specialty training, I was constantly put under the fire to deliver results despite a fire or not. I’ve also witnessed the workings of how an organization of 40,000 plus members operates and moves. And since my special training was involved in engineering, I was mostly utilized as a front-line technician. That means that myself and my subordinates worked in cramped, oily, dusty, and close quarters. So, I learned to work closely with my subordinates down in the trenches with them. By the end of the next month, I will have my Bachelor’s in Early Childhood Education. And by the end of summer, I plan to have my Master’s in Business Administration. So, what does my professional development say about my experience? I believe it says that I am used to working in professions that are not very well appreciated nor is considered the “star of the show”. I am used to working in the background and playing pivotal roles in the support aspect of operations. I am used to working in small businesses with less than 20 employees and I am used to working in an organization that employs more than 40,000 people. I am used to working closely with my subordinates and I am used to getting very, very dirty. I think my experience speaks for how I feel about leadership. But for clarity, I can explain that my idea of leadership can be best conveyed in the actions of a little-known carpenter nearly 2,000 years ago. If you’ve grown up in a Christian background, you may already know this story. If not, I will summarize very quickly. In the background of his great betrayal of his close friend, and his impending execution by the hands of his own people, Jesus gathered his close friends and students for one of the last few times his associates would spend with him. Jesus prepared himself for a strange ritual – he began to wash the feet of his disciples. It was customary at that time to wash the feet of your guests as gesture of servitude. Jesus, the man that was claimed to be from God himself, the Lord of all Mankind, the one who was purportedly at the beginning creation and even before then and afterwards, was humbly washing the feet of his disciples and students as a gesture of servitude and humility. Of course, there was more to the washing of his disciples’ feet than a mere gesture of servitude, but that is where we begin in my explanation of how I view leadership. Jesus was a leader. And if the Bible’s claims were to be true, that this Jesus character had all the authority on Earth, then he had every right to be as authoritative as he wanted. And yet, this man washed the feet of his disciples in order to serve their needs. This is my goal with you all. Though I am likely much more selfish and self-centered than this Jesus character, my goal is to wash your feet and to serve you. My goal as a leader is to equip you all with everything and in lacking nothing that you all may be able to also in turn, wash the feet of your students by serving their needs that they may be lacking in nothing. All too often we make a distinction between ourselves and our students as we are in a role of authority. And that authority can very easily be abused. Therefore, as a leader it is my utmost concern that I do not abuse this authority – and that a levy is created by serving your needs. Supervision is another aspect upon which I’d like to address. I want to be able to equip you all as leaders in your own right, striking it out on the frontiers on your own with your team. Supervision then is only necessary, if you all are responsible of your own accord, for when occasionally damage happens. It is life, and supervision, to my opinion, is judicial. That is, supervision arises when we need a judge and a jury to settle a dispute. I am doubtful that this need will arise often, but it does happen occasionally. In our occasion, it happens bi-annually when we come together for assessment of ourselves and our programs and our students. That is, we judge as a jury our own performance. Outline of Supervision and Evaluation I do not believe in a numerical grading system for the evaluation of my work nor for mine. Since our organization is not 40,000 strong like my previous employer, we can be much more qualitative in our evaluation and supervision. Our curriculum is straight forward. So is our goal. That is, to get children reading before they reach kindergarten. Therefor the results of our labor should be inherent in the students themselves. And since we share teaching the curriculum in no more than 30 minute intervals before the next teacher takes the teaching position of the one before him or her in an open classroom where all teachers are watching both the students and the teachers, it should be obvious then that the evaluation and supervisory outlines are daily and constant. Therefore, there is no quantitative approach to our evaluation. Every six months, however, teachers and supervisor will meet together in order to discuss practical issues. Is student A or B able to continue with our curriculum? Should he or she be instead expelled? Does any teacher have a problem noticed by the curriculum? And do any of the teachers have issues with any other teacher? Every six months the evaluation process will consist of letting out steam or unaired conflicts and to evaluate our students congregationally. Problem students cannot be allowed to continue in our curriculum, for the sake of the rest of the students. So every six months teachers will evaluate students to decide if one needs to be removed from our school. This is the extent of our evaluation and supervisory process. Summary of Specific Evaluation Tool to Use Our curriculum shall not have any specific evaluation tool to be used, especially since the state of Texas does not require one. However, for the sake of the exercise we will use the recommended appraisal of teachers recommended by the Texas Education Agency, an organization associated with the state of Texas. According to Texas Education Code §21.351, the recommended appraisal process be based on “observable, job-related behavior, including: (1) teachers’ implementation of discipline management procedures; and (2) the performance of teachers’ students.” (Texas Education Agency, 2018) This appraisal is recommended by the appraisal recommendation to be satisfied by the teacher’s supervisor or a person approved by the board of trustees. I am both of those. Under this recommended appraisal process, “appraisal for teachers must be detailed by category of professional skill and characteristic and must provide for separate ratings for each category. The appraisal process shall guarantee a conference between the teacher and appraiser. The conference shall be diagnostic and prescriptive with regard to remediation needed in overall performance and by category”. (Texas Education Agency, 2018) Therefore the recommended or specific evaluation tool shall be as listed above in the previous paragraphs seeing as the Texas Education Agency’s recommended appraisal tool matches our bi-annual congregationally led evaluation, on top of our evaluation of the students. The purpose of following our own evaluation process is this: first, as mentioned earlier, the state does not require a specific evaluation tool. Therefore, we have liberty to create our own tool. Second, because our curriculum is based around co-teaching. There are two classrooms in our curriculum. The first classroom is the beginner’s, and the second is the advanced. Both will follow this same teaching format. That is, all teachers will be in either the beginners or advanced class. And each teacher will teach take the center-stand and teach for no more than 30 minutes. Then another teacher that happens to be supervising the children from the back of the classroom will then teach the next 30-minute segment. And this continues. As you can see, the teachers are all constantly supervising each other. And since they are supervising each other, they all have a broad basis upon which to evaluate each other’s teaching. Therefore, a quantitative approach to evaluation is not needed. Instead, every six months teachers will gather and express encouragement or guidance on how their fellow colleagues could teach more efficiently or effectively. This style of co-teaching is not merely designed for the sake of the evaluation process but to mitigate the costly and high turn over rate that plagues the early childhood education industry. Teachers become burned out teaching a classroom of children for 8 to 10 hours a day for weeks on end. And since teachers are only teaching for 30 minutes each rotation, the total amount of teaching time is reduced to nearly half and therefore teachers can focus on providing a higher quality output of teaching and therefore that quality of work further stands for a higher quality of evaluation by his or her peers.

Introduction<br />
My name is Kon Ham, and I am most especially honored and pleased to be a part of your team. Please allow me to describe my professional background. My parents are small business owners. Most career business owners will understand – you’ve got to lose a few businesses before you win it big. I’ve personally witnessed my parents losing more than their share of businesses as a result of their own mistakes and failures. I’ve also seen them profit greatly as a result of proper management and unrelenting passion and vision. So, I have been close if not a mere witness to the ups and downs of business. I’ve also helped to manage those businesses. My background in the management of this business is that I have always been close to the source of the business – that is, the customer. Usually in the line of work my parents are involved in, the manager is also the front clerk. Therefore, the front clerk is where the manager makes the most of his or her experience being nearest to the business. After sometime of this, I impulsively left the family business and joined a military branch – The United States Coast Guard.<br />
In the United States Coast Guard, I learned to work consistently under pressure. From boot camp to petty officer indoctrination school, or in business terms mid-level manager school and work specialty training, I was constantly put under the fire to deliver results despite a fire or not. I’ve also witnessed the workings of how an organization of 40,000 plus members operates and moves. And since my special training was involved in engineering, I was mostly utilized as a front-line technician. That means that myself and my subordinates worked in cramped, oily, dusty, and close quarters. So, I learned to work closely with my subordinates down in the trenches with them. By the end of the next month, I will have my Bachelor’s in Early Childhood Education. And by the end of summer, I plan to have my Master’s in Business Administration.<br />
So, what does my professional development say about my experience? I believe it says that I am used to working in professions that are not very well appreciated nor is considered the “star of the show”. I am used to working in the background and playing pivotal roles in the support aspect of operations. I am used to working in small businesses with less than 20 employees and I am used to working in an organization that employs more than 40,000 people. I am used to working closely with my subordinates and I am used to getting very, very dirty. I think my experience speaks for how I feel about leadership. But for clarity, I can explain that my idea of leadership can be best conveyed in the actions of a little-known carpenter nearly 2,000 years ago. If you’ve grown up in a Christian background, you may already know this story. If not, I will summarize very quickly. In the background of his great betrayal of his close friend, and his impending execution by the hands of his own people, Jesus gathered his close friends and students for one of the last few times his associates would spend with him. Jesus prepared himself for a strange ritual – he began to wash the feet of his disciples. It was customary at that time to wash the feet of your guests as gesture of servitude. Jesus, the man that was claimed to be from God himself, the Lord of all Mankind, the one who was purportedly at the beginning creation and even before then and afterwards, was humbly washing the feet of his disciples and students as a gesture of servitude and humility. Of course, there was more to the washing of his disciples’ feet than a mere gesture of servitude, but that is where we begin in my explanation of how I view leadership.<br />
Jesus was a leader. And if the Bible’s claims were to be true, that this Jesus character had all the authority on Earth, then he had every right to be as authoritative as he wanted. And yet, this man washed the feet of his disciples in order to serve their needs. This is my goal with you all. Though I am likely much more selfish and self-centered than this Jesus character, my goal is to wash your feet and to serve you. My goal as a leader is to equip you all with everything and in lacking nothing that you all may be able to also in turn, wash the feet of your students by serving their needs that they may be lacking in nothing. All too often we make a distinction between ourselves and our students as we are in a role of authority. And that authority can very easily be abused. Therefore, as a leader it is my utmost concern that I do not abuse this authority – and that a levy is created by serving your needs. Supervision is another aspect upon which I’d like to address. I want to be able to equip you all as leaders in your own right, striking it out on the frontiers on your own with your team. Supervision then is only necessary, if you all are responsible of your own accord, for when occasionally damage happens. It is life, and supervision, to my opinion, is judicial. That is, supervision arises when we need a judge and a jury to settle a dispute. I am doubtful that this need will arise often, but it does happen occasionally. In our occasion, it happens bi-annually when we come together for assessment of ourselves and our programs and our students. That is, we judge as a jury our own performance.<br />
Outline of Supervision and Evaluation<br />
I do not believe in a numerical grading system for the evaluation of my work nor for mine. Since our organization is not 40,000 strong like my previous employer, we can be much more qualitative in our evaluation and supervision. Our curriculum is straight forward. So is our goal. That is, to get children reading before they reach kindergarten. Therefor the results of our labor should be inherent in the students themselves. And since we share teaching the curriculum in no more than 30 minute intervals before the next teacher takes the teaching position of the one before him or her in an open classroom where all teachers are watching both the students and the teachers, it should be obvious then that the evaluation and supervisory outlines are daily and constant. Therefore, there is no quantitative approach to our evaluation. Every six months, however, teachers and supervisor will meet together in order to discuss practical issues. Is student A or B able to continue with our curriculum? Should he or she be instead expelled? Does any teacher have a problem noticed by the curriculum? And do any of the teachers have issues with any other teacher? Every six months the evaluation process will consist of letting out steam or unaired conflicts and to evaluate our students congregationally. Problem students cannot be allowed to continue in our curriculum, for the sake of the rest of the students. So every six months teachers will evaluate students to decide if one needs to be removed from our school. This is the extent of our evaluation and supervisory process.<br />
Summary of Specific Evaluation Tool to Use<br />
Our curriculum shall not have any specific evaluation tool to be used, especially since the state of Texas does not require one. However, for the sake of the exercise we will use the recommended appraisal of teachers recommended by the Texas Education Agency, an organization associated with the state of Texas. According to Texas Education Code §21.351, the recommended appraisal process be based on “observable, job-related behavior, including: (1) teachers’ implementation of discipline management procedures; and (2) the performance of teachers’ students.” (Texas Education Agency, 2018) This appraisal is recommended by the appraisal recommendation to be satisfied by the teacher’s supervisor or a person approved by the board of trustees. I am both of those. Under this recommended appraisal process, “appraisal for teachers must be detailed by category of professional skill and characteristic and must provide for separate ratings for each category. The appraisal process shall guarantee a conference between the teacher and appraiser. The conference shall be diagnostic and prescriptive with regard to remediation needed in overall performance and by category”. (Texas Education Agency, 2018) Therefore the recommended or specific evaluation tool shall be as listed above in the previous paragraphs seeing as the Texas Education Agency’s recommended appraisal tool matches our bi-annual congregationally led evaluation, on top of our evaluation of the students.<br />
The purpose of following our own evaluation process is this: first, as mentioned earlier, the state does not require a specific evaluation tool. Therefore, we have liberty to create our own tool. Second, because our curriculum is based around co-teaching. There are two classrooms in our curriculum. The first classroom is the beginner’s, and the second is the advanced. Both will follow this same teaching format. That is, all teachers will be in either the beginners or advanced class. And each teacher will teach take the center-stand and teach for no more than 30 minutes. Then another teacher that happens to be supervising the children from the back of the classroom will then teach the next 30-minute segment. And this continues. As you can see, the teachers are all constantly supervising each other. And since they are supervising each other, they all have a broad basis upon which to evaluate each other’s teaching.<br />
Therefore, a quantitative approach to evaluation is not needed. Instead, every six months teachers will gather and express encouragement or guidance on how their fellow colleagues could teach more efficiently or effectively. This style of co-teaching is not merely designed for the sake of the evaluation process but to mitigate the costly and high turn over rate that plagues the early childhood education industry. Teachers become burned out teaching a classroom of children for 8 to 10 hours a day for weeks on end. And since teachers are only teaching for 30 minutes each rotation, the total amount of teaching time is reduced to nearly half and therefore teachers can focus on providing a higher quality output of teaching and therefore that quality of work further stands for a higher quality of evaluation by his or her peers.<br />

<p>Getting to Know You<br />
I look forward to the start of our friendship, family, and professional development. It starts with getting to know who you are as a person. Would you kindly fill out this questionnaire? It helps me get a deeper and broader understanding of who you are. First, the basics.<br />
How long have you been at this learning center?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>What is your role or assigned position at this learning center?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>What are some of the problems you see with our current program, and what are the strengths that you see with our program? Is there anything we should introduce? Is there anything we should discard?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>Is there any information I need to know in order to most fully serve you and to cater to you as an individual?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>An organization that is not constantly reforming and is not dynamic to the changes of the student’s needs, the economical market’s needs, and to the parent’s needs is a dying organization. What are the biggest problems you predict this organization will encounter in the next coming years?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>Implementation Plan<br />
On the basis of the two questionnaires I’ve asked from you all, I will plan to do the following: reform is necessary and while the mission statement and core values must be consistent, if they are still relevant to us, the rest of the organization must be adapting to changing needs. I’m sure some of you are concerned about the growing need for diversity sensitive classrooms. I am aware that the classrooms of today will not look like the classrooms of tomorrow. And what about the falling price of technology and how that enables us to better teach our students? What technological devices do we include in the classroom of the future, today? And how can we make our classroom environment the place where professional educators can be proud to call their second home? The first step to the change is dialogue and discussion, which is why we will set aside time every bi-annually. This session is designed to, in a congregational form, discuss future developments and potential problems to be resolved. We must all stay on the same page, and in order to do so there must be a culture of free dialogue. Often, we must say things we feel uncomfortable to say but we do not. I cannot guarantee that we will always feel good about what is said but I can guarantee that I will be a part of the culture in which discussion happens all of the time, without repercussion. It is through dialogue that truth is revealed slowly but surely. Therefore, that is the first step I will implement. It is in that spirit of free discussion that I also intend to encourage in our evaluation of each other. We are limited by own knowledge and experience. There is something that you as a professional educator can and must say in order for your colleague to become better. And one day that same attitude will benefit you as well. Because such a process of growth is reciprocal, it is imperative that we begin that process as quickly as possible. That first step begins with you, expressing your thoughts, feelings, and ideas to each other.<br />
When it comes to problems that need action and reconciliation, the supervisory role that we all play must change into the role of judicial processes. We will all act as a jury in order to judge the event and to prescribe a solution. In all of us is a judge also that must make the decision and take steps to correcting a wrong. This also happens in our bi-annual meeting. What about staff members that cannot or are unable to meet the expectations that we hold collectively as a staff? I can only execute the final wish of the staff members, who must collectively decide whether or not to keep the staff member or to release him or her. If the need for a prescription instead of a removal of the staff member is in order, then the staff members will also collectively decide which actions to take. I have purposely left out specifics of what the treatment ought to be for the various problems relating to performance ought to be. This is because I am hoping to create an organization that can be constantly reforming and dynamic on the basis of what our core beliefs are, as defined in our mission statement and core values. Documentation of all actions that the staff wishes to take is documented in the meeting by all party members. Of course, we can utilize technology to our advantage and we can record the meeting through the use of a recorder, in case we need to look back at our past decisions. To clearly define what and when and where these bi-annual meetings will take place, I will suggest the following. First, the meeting shall take place in February and in August, both on the 15th of each month, more or less depending on revolving weekends. They will be held in our classrooms, and we shall meet for as long as necessary to convey needed messages, critiques, evaluations of teachers, expulsions of students, release of staff members, voicing of concerns for the future projects, and so on.<br />
Evaluation of This Plan and of My Leadership<br />
How then can I be evaluated as a role of a supervisor and director of this learning center? There must be a few points of criteria that I must specifically meet. That is, cohesion of the faculty members, productivity of the teachers, results of the students in being able to read before kindergarten, the expelling of faculty members unable to meet standards, the expelling of students that are causing problems to the curriculum and the rest of the students, and the economical success of the learning center. As we say in the naval service, it is a matter of whether or not I am running “a tight ship”. Therefore, the previously mentioned criteria should serve as a guideline of evaluation that I must meet when I am reviewed by the board of trustees. Since we focus on qualitative assessments of each other I am also held to the same standards that our faculty impress upon each other. This refinement process should occur through a process of evaluations that all of us incur when our bi-annual meeting occurs.</p>
