<meta name="description" content="A For the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, the following symptoms of the 12-year-old patient were noticed. First, she displays fidgeting, chews her hair, and does not like to be in new situations. Possibly the dislike of being in new situations brings about the fidgeting and the chewing of the hair. But the case study does not clarify. She appears to have a difficult time staying seated in class. She says that it is not comfortable, though the case study does not clarify if she meant that the chair was uncomfortable in the potential context of an anxiety disorder. Her condition relating to sitting in the chair apparently gets worse on test days with the claim that she is not feeling well. Her report that she has no friends could be a result of having a form of social anxiety. Her family history displays anxiety disorders on the mother’s side of the family, with both the mother and grandmother coping with panic attacks. The patient’s father is in the Navy and is gone for long periods. The patient appears to demonstrate some form of separation anxiety when her father leaves. B First, I would make use of a clinical interview. If the child has a form of anxiety then what would be needed initially would be to make use of a clinical interview to make observations but also to build rapport with the child. (Kring et al., 2018) He or she may not be able to trust the therapist enough to give the therapist responsive answers. The pro to this method would be that the interviewer would get a clearer understanding of what the 12-year-old patient thinks and feels instead of the initial observations made by the case study. A con of this method would be that a therapist must be careful not to ask leading questions and often times this method takes time because of the needed rapport building before the patient feels comfortable to answer honestly with the therapist. (Kring et al., 2018) Second, I would conduct an official structured assessment with the use of the “Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders” or SCARED. This assessment allows for both the child and the parent to fill out a questionnaire. The final score is added together to provide further insight whether or not the child may have a form of clinical anxiety. A total score of 25 or more will indicate that the child may have a form of anxiety. The benefit to this assessment is that the scores are broken down into various forms of anxiety, which would help the therapist target specifically which form of anxiety to provide for therapy. For example, a score of 5 for items or questions 4, 8, 13, 16, 20, 25, 29, 31 would indicate that the patient may have a form of separation anxiety disorder which would explain some of the behavior that the patient exhibits like for example, when her father goes away on military deployment. A con to this method would be that the child may not fully understand the depth of the questions being asked. Even with the help of a parent or a teacher, the child may have trouble with the interpretation of the question. Second, a parent filling out the card may be limited in the perception of the child because in our example of the 12-year-old patient, the father may not be around the child often enough to be able to assess the child, even with the structured questions. C First the matter of family history – the patient’s family has a history of anxiety on the mother’s side. Both the mother and the grandmother display signs of anxiety and still cope with panic attacks. Twin studies and family association studies have demonstrated a link with genetic material and the environment. (Manassis, 2002) The link between the patient’s family history, the environment that she lives in as well as studies that indicate the relationship between the two likely make to build for a strong case of anxiety in the patient. Furthermore, the patient demonstrates numerous health issues. She has migraines, severe food allergies, a history of seizures, and developmental milestone delays. The patient also has a heart condition in which her heartrate beats more rapidly than normal. Such a condition can lead to an infant experiencing irritability, sweating, rapid breathing, poor feeding and poor weight gain. (Cardiology Associates of Houston, 2018) It is not a stretch of imagination to assume that the patient is generally uncomfortable due to the many health issues she experiences. Anxiety is linked with a higher rate of cardiovascular disease along with other medical conditions. (Kring et al., 2018) D The common trait of therapy for anxiety related disorders is exposure. (Kring et al., 2018) This form of therapy seeks to reduce the triggers that elicit the anxiety or fear. Usually, therapists and the patient get together to form a list of fears and will start by ranking those fears from least to greatest. This is called an “exposure hierarchy”. In this exposure hierarchy, patients learn to deal with the triggers – usually starting with the ones that elicit the smallest amount of anxiety and fear – and are gradually moved up the exposure hierarchy as patients learn to overcome the anxiety. This form of therapy is effective for 70-90% of patients. (Kring et al., 2018) The amount of time I would recommend for our patient would be a six-month period in which she learns to handle her anxiety through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy by exposure of triggers. There is a statistical significance to the six-month period. The six-month period is the minimal amount of time required for the effects of the therapy to endure. (Kring et al., 2018) If after six months the symptoms do not appear to lessen then a secondary option can be considered for the patient. The patient, with the parent’s approval, can be a D-cycloserine treatment. D-cycloserine, or DCS, enhances the learning process. (Kring et al., 2018) Studies have shown that DCS had diminished the amount of fear that a patient experienced with regards to acrophobia in a test that involved one group taking DCS and another taking a placebo. This drug is taken in conjunction with CBT and so far, the drug appears to enhance CBT. (Kring et al., 2018) The downside to this drug is that it is fairly new so there are only selective offerings of DCS available to patients. E Anxiety may be the most common form of psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Women, more than men, are also much more likely to fall into this category. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) The screening process for our 12-year-old patient is recommended through the use of rating the severity of anxious symptoms. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore, according to this recommendation we have selected the SCARED structured assessment in order to develop the diagnosis that the patient has a form of anxiety disorder. The SCARED assessment allows for both the parent and child to evaluate the anxious symptoms which would be a benefit to the therapists and those seeking to diagnose the patient because the patient may have some difficulty in the interpretation of the questions. Parent answered questions about the patient may provide for more clarity and consistency. This screening process must carefully assess whether the symptoms experienced by the patient are related to anxiety or if there are comorbid symptoms relating to a medical condition. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) There is a benefit to the SCARED test in that it is available for free online. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) There are multiple studies that point toward hereditary relationships between anxiety disorders and genetics. (Manassis, 2002) Twin studies, family association studies, temperamental risk-factors all point toward heredity in anxiety. The patient has both mother and grandmother that experience anxiety through panic attacks. All three generations of these women appear to express a continuity in expression of anxiety. Behavior inhibition is a matter of temperament. (Manassis, 2002) What would be useful to the clinician would be if the mother of the 12-year-old patient displayed symptoms of behavior inhibition and if our 12-year-old patient also expressed behavior inhibition when she was younger. Furthermore, there needs to be further evaluation what sort of developmental milestone delays occurred in our patient’s life. Behavior inhibition may have occurred as a result of our patient being unable to develop at a normal rate. Furthermore, parenting styles are also to be brought into question. Likely the stress of the patient having medical abnormalities as well as many other limitations such as allergies and developmental delays could have caused the parents to seek to shelter the patient from new outcomes. Parents assist children in overcoming behavioral inhibition through the use of encouraging and guiding the child. (Manassis, 2002) However, the mother of our patient has anxiety also – there could be once source of anxiety for our patient. That being said CBT has benefits for young children and caretaker alike. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Specifically, the “psychoeducation of child and caregivers regarding the nature of anxiety; techniques for managing somatic reactions including relaxation training and diaphragmatic breathing; cognitive restructuring by identifying and challenging anxiety-provoking thoughts” and so on. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) In studies relating to the effectiveness of CBT, CBT was found more effective by a margin of 24% compared to placebo groups, whereas CBT in conjunction with medication was found to be 81% more effective compared to CBT alone (60%), or simply the medication (55%). (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) However, the same study has shown that the relapse rate for acute sufferers tend to be nearly half of the participants. It is clear that CBT and CBT in conjunction with medication is not the only solution to this long-term disorder. Our patient is statistically at a disadvantage when it comes to predictors of success. According to one study, those with first-degree relatives had “poorer functional outcomes”. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore it may be necessary to provide for the patient CBT that includes holistically, both parents or simply the mother as a secondary patient. There may be some form of a feedback loop between the patient and the mother and it is likely that both need a form of psychoeducation to further equip the parents and the patient with abilities to cope with the anxiety. I have not recommended the use of psychiatric drugs because of the low level of success with long term results. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) It is the many variables of anxiety that can potentially confound therapists in the diagnosis of the disorder, it being necessary to carefully select which symptoms relate to anxiety itself or are a result of comorbidity. Our 12-year-old patient suffers from multiple health problems, severe food allergies being one issue. Specifically, food allergies have been linked to anxiety. (Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, 2018) Our patient reports having no friends in school. She may be struggling with dealing with her medical issues while at the same time attempting to get along with her peers. Food allergies, which are potentially life or death situations, can be very stressful to a girl that would like to sit down and have a meal with her peers. Furthermore, though the relationship between food allergies and anxiety is not entirely clear, though being very clearly linked together, it could be hypothesized that the food allergies brings some sort of embarrassment to the person. To summarize – our patient suffers from anxiety. Her mother and her grandmother also have anxiety and still to this day experience panic attacks. It is clear that the anxiety the mother and grandmother have is not diagnosed. CBT with the mother’s involvement would greatly benefit both the patient and the mother. The patient also suffers from medical conditions and developmental milestone delays. Therefore, on top of the anxiety that the patient experiences, potentially, would be the comorbidity of other symptoms relating to her medical illness. It is therefore very important to make a proper assessment of the anxiety and to attempt to interpret symptoms in the light that she may not have anxiety but rather anxiety like symptoms relating to her medical condition. That is why I have suggested the use of the SCARED assessment with both her and her parents to take the assessment. This would further reduce the chance of misdiagnosis by the therapist since both the parents and the child will answer to the assessment separately. An informal clinical interview also ought to be set up before a formal structured assessment in order to build rapport with the patient. (Kring et al., 2018) Once rapport has been built and with parental approval, CBT can begin. As mentioned earlier, a minimum treatment plan of at least 6 months is recommended. This is statistically significant that the patient completes at least 6 months of therapy as that is the amount of time on average required to see an effect from the therapy. If after six months therapy does not appear to show significant effect, then CBT with the use of D-cycloserine is recommended. This is a drug that aids in the learning process and is not a benzodiazepine, as studies have shown the ineffectiveness of benzodiazepine in treatment of young children and juveniles. It is for that purpose I have not recommended medication. Finally, my recommendation is for the family to begin CBT together as a family, or as much as possibly allowed considering the father’s work schedule. The father may not be around often enough to experience the full effect of his spouse’s anxiety and panic attacks, but likely he is well aware of them. The domain of anxiety has many triggers and with a family of anxiety sufferers likely the negative feedback loop continues. This must be a family effort to improve the mental health of the daughter, mother, and even grandmother. The patient is statistically not likely to make a recovery due to the family history, environment, and numerous medical conditions. But the first start can be from within the home. And it is this author’s belief that the home is where the therapy should begin. References Cardiology Associates of Houston. (2018). Atrial Tachycardia – Pediatric Cardiology Associates of Houston.

The final score is added together to provide further insight whether or not the child may have a form of clinical anxiety. A total score of 25 or more will indicate that the child may have a form of anxiety. The benefit to this assessment is that the scores are broken down into various forms of anxiety, which would help the therapist target specifically which form of anxiety to provide for therapy. For example, a score of 5 for items or questions 4, 8, 13, 16, 20, 25, 29, 31 would indicate that the patient may have a form of separation anxiety disorder which would explain some of the behavior that the patient exhibits like for example, when her father goes away on military deployment. A con to this method would be that the child may not fully understand the depth of the questions being asked. Even with the help of a parent or a teacher, the child may have trouble with the interpretation of the question. Second, a parent filling out the card may be limited in the perception of the child because in our example of the 12-year-old patient, the father may not be around the child often enough to be able to assess the child, even with the structured questions. C First the matter of family history – the patient’s family has a history of anxiety on the mother’s side. Both the mother and the grandmother display signs of anxiety and still cope with panic attacks. Twin studies and family association studies have demonstrated a link with genetic material and the environment. (Manassis, 2002) The link between the patient’s family history, the environment that she lives in as well as studies that indicate the relationship between the two likely make to build for a strong case of anxiety in the patient. Furthermore, the patient demonstrates numerous health issues. She has migraines, severe food allergies, a history of seizures, and developmental milestone delays. The patient also has a heart condition in which her heartrate beats more rapidly than normal. Such a condition can lead to an infant experiencing irritability, sweating, rapid breathing, poor feeding and poor weight gain. (Cardiology Associates of Houston, 2018) It is not a stretch of imagination to assume that the patient is generally uncomfortable due to the many health issues she experiences. Anxiety is linked with a higher rate of cardiovascular disease along with other medical conditions. (Kring et al., 2018) D The common trait of therapy for anxiety related disorders is exposure. (Kring et al., 2018) This form of therapy seeks to reduce the triggers that elicit the anxiety or fear. Usually, therapists and the patient get together to form a list of fears and will start by ranking those fears from least to greatest. This is called an “exposure hierarchy”. In this exposure hierarchy, patients learn to deal with the triggers – usually starting with the ones that elicit the smallest amount of anxiety and fear – and are gradually moved up the exposure hierarchy as patients learn to overcome the anxiety. This form of therapy is effective for 70-90% of patients. (Kring et al., 2018) The amount of time I would recommend for our patient would be a six-month period in which she learns to handle her anxiety through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy by exposure of triggers. There is a statistical significance to the six-month period. The six-month period is the minimal amount of time required for the effects of the therapy to endure. (Kring et al., 2018) If after six months the symptoms do not appear to lessen then a secondary option can be considered for the patient. The patient, with the parent’s approval, can be a D-cycloserine treatment. D-cycloserine, or DCS, enhances the learning process. (Kring et al., 2018) Studies have shown that DCS had diminished the amount of fear that a patient experienced with regards to acrophobia in a test that involved one group taking DCS and another taking a placebo. This drug is taken in conjunction with CBT and so far, the drug appears to enhance CBT. (Kring et al., 2018) The downside to this drug is that it is fairly new so there are only selective offerings of DCS available to patients. E Anxiety may be the most common form of psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Women, more than men, are also much more likely to fall into this category. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) The screening process for our 12-year-old patient is recommended through the use of rating the severity of anxious symptoms. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore, according to this recommendation we have selected the SCARED structured assessment in order to develop the diagnosis that the patient has a form of anxiety disorder. The SCARED assessment allows for both the parent and child to evaluate the anxious symptoms which would be a benefit to the therapists and those seeking to diagnose the patient because the patient may have some difficulty in the interpretation of the questions. Parent answered questions about the patient may provide for more clarity and consistency. This screening process must carefully assess whether the symptoms experienced by the patient are related to anxiety or if there are comorbid symptoms relating to a medical condition. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) There is a benefit to the SCARED test in that it is available for free online. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) There are multiple studies that point toward hereditary relationships between anxiety disorders and genetics. (Manassis, 2002) Twin studies, family association studies, temperamental risk-factors all point toward heredity in anxiety. The patient has both mother and grandmother that experience anxiety through panic attacks. All three generations of these women appear to express a continuity in expression of anxiety. Behavior inhibition is a matter of temperament. (Manassis, 2002) What would be useful to the clinician would be if the mother of the 12-year-old patient displayed symptoms of behavior inhibition and if our 12-year-old patient also expressed behavior inhibition when she was younger. Furthermore, there needs to be further evaluation what sort of developmental milestone delays occurred in our patient’s life. Behavior inhibition may have occurred as a result of our patient being unable to develop at a normal rate. Furthermore, parenting styles are also to be brought into question. Likely the stress of the patient having medical abnormalities as well as many other limitations such as allergies and developmental delays could have caused the parents to seek to shelter the patient from new outcomes. Parents assist children in overcoming behavioral inhibition through the use of encouraging and guiding the child. (Manassis, 2002) However, the mother of our patient has anxiety also – there could be once source of anxiety for our patient. That being said CBT has benefits for young children and caretaker alike. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Specifically, the “psychoeducation of child and caregivers regarding the nature of anxiety; techniques for managing somatic reactions including relaxation training and diaphragmatic breathing; cognitive restructuring by identifying and challenging anxiety-provoking thoughts” and so on. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) In studies relating to the effectiveness of CBT, CBT was found more effective by a margin of 24% compared to placebo groups, whereas CBT in conjunction with medication was found to be 81% more effective compared to CBT alone (60%), or simply the medication (55%). (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) However, the same study has shown that the relapse rate for acute sufferers tend to be nearly half of the participants. It is clear that CBT and CBT in conjunction with medication is not the only solution to this long-term disorder. Our patient is statistically at a disadvantage when it comes to predictors of success. According to one study, those with first-degree relatives had “poorer functional outcomes”. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore it may be necessary to provide for the patient CBT that includes holistically, both parents or simply the mother as a secondary patient. There may be some form of a feedback loop between the patient and the mother and it is likely that both need a form of psychoeducation to further equip the parents and the patient with abilities to cope with the anxiety. I have not recommended the use of psychiatric drugs because of the low level of success with long term results. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp; Strawn, 2015) It is the many variables of anxiety that can potentially confound therapists in the diagnosis of the disorder, it being necessary to carefully select which symptoms relate to anxiety itself or are a result of comorbidity. Our 12-year-old patient suffers from multiple health problems, severe food allergies being one issue. Specifically, food allergies have been linked to anxiety. (Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, 2018) Our patient reports having no friends in school. She may be struggling with dealing with her medical issues while at the same time attempting to get along with her peers. Food allergies, which are potentially life or death situations, can be very stressful to a girl that would like to sit down and have a meal with her peers. Furthermore, though the relationship between food allergies and anxiety is not entirely clear, though being very clearly linked together, it could be hypothesized that the food allergies brings some sort of embarrassment to the person. To summarize – our patient suffers from anxiety. Her mother and her grandmother also have anxiety and still to this day experience panic attacks. It is clear that the anxiety the mother and grandmother have is not diagnosed. CBT with the mother’s involvement would greatly benefit both the patient and the mother. The patient also suffers from medical conditions and developmental milestone delays. Therefore, on top of the anxiety that the patient experiences, potentially, would be the comorbidity of other symptoms relating to her medical illness. It is therefore very important to make a proper assessment of the anxiety and to attempt to interpret symptoms in the light that she may not have anxiety but rather anxiety like symptoms relating to her medical condition. That is why I have suggested the use of the SCARED assessment with both her and her parents to take the assessment. This would further reduce the chance of misdiagnosis by the therapist since both the parents and the child will answer to the assessment separately. An informal clinical interview also ought to be set up before a formal structured assessment in order to build rapport with the patient. (Kring et al., 2018) Once rapport has been built and with parental approval, CBT can begin. As mentioned earlier, a minimum treatment plan of at least 6 months is recommended. This is statistically significant that the patient completes at least 6 months of therapy as that is the amount of time on average required to see an effect from the therapy. If after six months therapy does not appear to show significant effect, then CBT with the use of D-cycloserine is recommended. This is a drug that aids in the learning process and is not a benzodiazepine, as studies have shown the ineffectiveness of benzodiazepine in treatment of young children and juveniles. It is for that purpose I have not recommended medication. Finally, my recommendation is for the family to begin CBT together as a family, or as much as possibly allowed considering the father’s work schedule. The father may not be around often enough to experience the full effect of his spouse’s anxiety and panic attacks, but likely he is well aware of them. The domain of anxiety has many triggers and with a family of anxiety sufferers likely the negative feedback loop continues. This must be a family effort to improve the mental health of the daughter, mother, and even grandmother. The patient is statistically not likely to make a recovery due to the family history, environment, and numerous medical conditions. But the first start can be from within the home. And it is this author’s belief that the home is where the therapy should begin. References Cardiology Associates of Houston. (2018). Atrial Tachycardia – Pediatric Cardiology Associates of Houston.

  <p>A<br />
For the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, the following symptoms of the 12-year-old patient were noticed. First, she displays fidgeting, chews her hair, and does not like to be in new situations. Possibly the dislike of being in new situations brings about the fidgeting and the chewing of the hair. But the case study does not clarify. She appears to have a difficult time staying seated in class. She says that it is not comfortable, though the case study does not clarify if she meant that the chair was uncomfortable in the potential context of an anxiety disorder. Her condition relating to sitting in the chair apparently gets worse on test days with the claim that she is not feeling well. Her report that she has no friends could be a result of having a form of social anxiety. Her family history displays anxiety disorders on the mother’s side of the family, with both the mother and grandmother coping with panic attacks. The patient’s father is in the Navy and is gone for long periods. The patient appears to demonstrate some form of separation anxiety when her father leaves.<br />
B<br />
First, I would make use of a clinical interview. If the child has a form of anxiety then what would be needed initially would be to make use of a clinical interview to make observations but also to build rapport with the child. (Kring et al., 2018) He or she may not be able to trust the therapist enough to give the therapist responsive answers. The pro to this method would be that the interviewer would get a clearer understanding of what the 12-year-old patient thinks and feels instead of the initial observations made by the case study. A con of this method would be that a therapist must be careful not to ask leading questions and often times this method takes time because of the needed rapport building before the patient feels comfortable to answer honestly with the therapist. (Kring et al., 2018)<br />
Second, I would conduct an official structured assessment with the use of the “Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders” or SCARED. This assessment allows for both the child and the parent to fill out a questionnaire. The final score is added together to provide further insight whether or not the child may have a form of clinical anxiety. A total score of 25 or more will indicate that the child may have a form of anxiety.

A con to this method would be that the child may not fully understand the depth of the questions being asked. Even with the help of a parent or a teacher, the child may have trouble with the interpretation of the question.
