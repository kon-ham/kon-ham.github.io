  <li>Case Description<br />
    A. Demographic Description<br />
    Harry Potter is a 38-year-old male that has grown up in the United Kingdom. Culturally he appears to be of a middle-class background with both a Muggle and Wizarding upbringing. Both Harry Potter’s parents passed away at a young age so Harry Potter was raised by his aunt and uncle. His uncle, Vernon, was a junior executive at Grunnings, a drill-making company in Surrey, England. Harry Potter’s aunt, Petunia, went to London to become a typist before meeting Vernon and being married to him. Petunia is somewhat acquainted with the Muggle world, as Petunia’s sister, Harry’s mother, was a witch. Harry Potter is heterosexual. He is married to Ginny and has three children. He is currently employed by the Ministry of Magic as an auror. He has no stated religion of affiliation. He is a graduate of Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />
    B. Referral Method<br />
    Harry Potter was referred to us by The Ministry of Magic. Due to the level of work that Aurors tend to be involved in, the Ministry of Magic has decreed that all aurors be evaluated yearly by a trained counselor in order to determine the mental state of the individual. Harry Potter himself appears to have no opinion on the matter. He is very professional in his approach to his opinion.<br />
    C. Appearance, Behavior, and Mental Status<br />
    Harry Potter wears glasses and has a scar on his forehead. His clothes appear to be clean but they look a little worn and creased in certain areas. Of particular note is Harry Potter’s hair, which looks like a comb would be defeated in attempting to groom it. Harry Potter appears to be distant in his communication, though not entirely unfriendly. He describes his situation and his background with a sort of professional demeanor, if not slightly distant. His gaze is intense and given his background, appears to be typical of an individual with historical trauma.<br />
    D. History<br />
    Harry Potter has suffered from a form of post traumatic stress disorder as well as depression typical of those that have suffered that level of trauma. When I asked how long he’s experienced his feelings of depression he has replied “Always.” When asked how often he’s experienced those feelings he says “A bit.” When I pressed him for more details about the frequency of the symptoms, he says sometimes when he is ready for bed or when his head hurts. I ask him if the scar was the reason for his pain and he says “Probably.” I take note of his ambiguity in describing his situation.<br />
    Harry Potter’s parents were, according to him, very much in love when I asked him about his parents. This was before I knew that his parents had deceased from when he was a young boy. He tells me that when he was a young boy, he was taken into the care by an Albus Dumbledore, who had sought to bring him under the protection of Vernon and Petunia. Harry tells me that Vernon and Petunia did not like him very much, and he supposes that this is the result of Petunia being jealous of Harry’s mother, Lily, and therefore despising Harry because Harry also exhibited the same magical potential that Lily had. I asked if he lived with any siblings, or if Petunia and Vernon had any children that Harry had lived with, and Harry tells me that he has a cousin named Dudley. He also tells me that there was once a relative that also had passed away, who was named Sirius Black. This was Harry’s Godfather. His current family is his own, Ginny is his wife and they have three children, James, Albus, and Lily.<br />
    Harry Potter is somewhat of a celebrity in the Magical world. According to the Magical world, Harry Potter is “The Boy who Lived”. And as such, he is well known around the magical realm. Apart from this, Harry Potter manages to have a few close friends. They are, Ron and Hermione, Neville, and Hagrid. These friends have also been with Harry through many traumatic moments. When speaking about his friends it is obvious that Harry holds these relationships very dear to him. He also appears to be distant with the majority of his peers and coworkers. Harry seemed to be wanting to be left alone from the majority of his peers and coworkers, who appear to view Harry as some sort of saint or prophet. Harry’s original teachers viewed Harry in a very positive light, seeing the exceptional characteristics of Harry’s past and his present experience.<br />
    Harry’s past academic achievement, though spotty here and there, appears to be held in high regard. Furthermore, his work as an Auror is, according to the Ministry of Magic, impeccable though at times unorthodox. Some of his superiors seem to suggest that Harry has a slight problem with authority though being unable to cite a concrete example of Harry’s unorthodox approach.<br />
    Harry has been hospitalized many times in the past due to his passion in Quidditch as well as sustaining multiple injuries when Voldemort, a rogue wizard, attempted to take over the world. On top of that, there appears to be some form of substance abuse, as Harry mentions he’d taken a “Polyjuice Potion” but the effects of the drug are lost on the counselor. Though Harry says he does not suffer from eating and weight control, he mentions that sometimes he stays up at night thinking about the past and the friends and schoolmates he had lost.<br />
    He does not appear to have any other counseling history as this is the first year that the Ministry of Magic has mandated a yearly diagnosis of the Aurors. Harry also mentioned that he thought it was strange that the Ministry of Magic would assign the counseling to Muggles, which I have learned that such a word is in reference to those that are without magical powers.</li>
  <li>Multicultural Considerations<br />
    Harry Potter has come from two different multicultural backgrounds. The first is that of the Muggle world. I am told that the word Muggle is used by the Wizarding world to describe a person that is not magically oriented. Upon further assessment, I am learning that Muggle itself is not a derogatory word but there do appear to be words to assign to a Muggle that is indeed derogatory. Harry is familiar with the cultural references of the Muggle world, but he does not appear to be up to date with current cultural events as he has spent the majority of his adult life in the Wizarding world. In the wizarding world, wizards are fascinated by how Muggles get along with their lives without the use of magic, for example how cars are powered by internal combustion as compared to the car being magically enchanted. Apparently, cars in the magical world can even fly. Though the common language between the Muggle and Magical world is equally English, there are words, like the world Muggle, that are used exclusively by the magical world. Therefore, Harry’s magical culture appears to be much more exclusive than that of the Muggle world. Apparently, most wizards and witches are assigned a wand, or a wand “selects” a wizard or a witch and that it is a unique imprint upon that witch or wizard that cannot be easily used by others. I have attempted to discover any parallel or equivalent concepts that exist in the Muggle world but yet such an attempt still escapes me. However, I have found that the magical world has a game known as Quidditch, which could possibly be similar to Cricket and football, both sports well known in the English portion of the Muggle world. From what I am told, Quidditch is a game that is played internationally, and I have found that football also is played internationally.<br />
    This understanding of what magic is and how much it influences Harry’s world is potentially a problem and an obstacle of understanding for me. I am, according to this world, a Muggle. And that means that I’m just not inclined to magic in any sort of way. I was told by Harry that Petunia had sent a letter to Hogwarts, asking Albus Dumbledore if she could also attend the school along with Lilly and that Albus regretfully declined her request. Although I am completely oblivious to the magical underworking of Harry’s magical world, I am convinced that I will still be able to make a full evaluation of Harry’s mental state and to offer to him potential solutions to his situation.</li>
  <li>Initial Assessment<br />
    My assessment of Harry Potter is that he is a victim of post traumatic stress disorder. The events surrounding Harry Potter was what was called in the magical world, the Second Wizarding War, in which Voldemort makes his second attempted ascension to power. Harry Potter’s life dramatically changed when Harry’s parents were killed by Voldemort – they were fighting a war against Voldemort and because Harry was the child of James and Lily, active participants in the First Wizarding War, Harry was unwillingly brought into the conflict. His parents were killed and due to a strange circumstance, Harry was left alive, though he should have also died. There remains a mark on Harry’s forehead that is evident to the wizarding world – a mark that was left on Harry by one of the wizarding world’s most feared wizard of all time. This, though Harry finds out this history of his life later when he is accepted into Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is likely a large part of the reasons why he may feel symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, Harry was raised as a child by Vernon and Petunia, who made no attempt to hide their active disgust for Harry and his parents. Harry was also likely affected by the revealing of his past and his famous role, though unwittingly, of both the First and Second Wizarding War. Throughout his academic career Harry was a constant witness to death and destruction as well as the revealing of key figures of his life important to him to mostly be a lie and fabrication, though some of the lies being put in place in order to protect Harry. In the last academic year of his life at Hogwart’s, Harry is forced to encounter Voldemort and to defeat him, a no doubt large feat for a young boy his age. His many mentors and loved ones had passed away due to the destruction of the evil that Voldemort plotted, mainly the death of Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and Sirius Black. Harry furthermore had to struggle with the downtimes of his life when he would have to return back home to his Muggle caretakers, Vernon and Petunia, who would rather have pretended that he did not exist. Although Harry was able to keep in contact with his friends from Hogwarts, he was mostly kept in isolation. Speaking of this isolation, Harry had to deal with being a celebrity in a role that he played no active part in. He is known in the Wizarding World as “The Boy Who Lived”, and is reminded that he is known for being a boy that survived the terrible murder of his parents while he managed to escape, though without his own understanding of how he managed such a feat. During his career at Hogwarts, he is told that there is a man that was looking to kill him. This man, known as Sirius Black, is later revealed that Sirius was betrayed by minions of Voldemort and was actually in fact, a close friend of James and Lily and Harry Potter’s godfather. Time and time again things that Harry knew to be true regarding his circumstance and his life were found to be either untrue at all or that things were not exactly as they seemed. It is miraculous that Harry has survived through these emotionally stressful times and is still managing a somewhat normal life and career, evidenced in his stellar career as an Auror. However, it would appear to be that the First and Second Wizarding War left a large imprint on Harry Potter. Though he has not yet smiled with me, I am told that he is a loving father to Ginny, a woman he greatly loves, and is a caring father to his three children. His friends also know Harry to be a man with great courage though at times a bit intense, as I have personally experienced. His ambiguity describing his past with me and how he deals now with the past of his life conveys this sort of intensity. When I asked him if he disliked my probing of his questions he said, “Not really.” I looked at his portfolio and have found mention of a certain Rita Skeeter. Upon further evaluation I have found that this person had knowingly as a reporter and journalist spread untruthful statements about Harry, especially during a period known as the Triwizard Tournament, an incredibly dangerous game in which a young boy and friend of Harry Potter, Cedric Diggory, was killed. From this I can understand if he harbors any sense of distrust towards me.<br />
    My hypothesis of Harry’s circumstance is that he is an individual with a traumatic past with multiple identity crises resulting from not knowing his parent’s true past until he became eligible to enter Hogwart’s as well as finding out that his so-called killer was in fact his godfather. I also assume that the Second Wizarding War left a traumatic imprint on him in the same manner soldiers experience when encountering war and having had his or her friends killed in combat, resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder. The goal for this counseling is to provide for him solutions for coping with the disorder especially during periods when he is alone or is reminiscing the past, as well as providing him tools to transition into his mid-life as a father and a husband and perhaps, to be a grandfather.</li>
  <li>Counseling Models<br />
    Adlerian therapy through the use of solution-focused brief therapy suggest the use of encouragement in order to facilitate change in an individual. (Watts &amp; Pietrzak, 2000) First the counselor does this by changing the perception of the situation and allowing individuals to disengage from negative behaviors and actions. In essence, to change the “doing” and the “viewing” of the situation allows clients to change behavior. Then in doing so the counselor also seeks to extract resources or solutions (Watts &amp; Pietrzak, 2000) for the client to apply to his or her own life. Wheeler, Kern, and Curlette in 1993 developed an adaptive lifestyle inventory based on Adlerian psychology. Taking this inventory would possibly help Harry to see quantitative data on his skills as a person that adapts and overcomes situations. (Stoltz, Wolff, Monroe, Farris, &amp; Mazahreh, 2013)<br />
    If I am unable to establish rapport with Harry then my attempts at encouragement could be seen as shallow or that I am doing so with ulterior motives. Therefore, this model could have drawbacks if my relationship with Harry does not grow further or if I am not allowed enough time with Harry to establish that rapport.<br />
    Person-centered therapy focuses on the ability to establish rapport with the client and to give full trust to the client that he or she can be empowered to change his or her own life. This process first starts with the emphatic approach to the client. (Glauser &amp; Bozarth, 2001) This form of therapy does not have specific models of technique for a counselor to follow but rather emphasizes instead the wholly on the client. (Glauser &amp; Bozarth, 2001) The drawback to this method is that this method may take time for Harry to choose to engage in the therapy.<br />
    With existential therapy a counselor can advise the client to explore the present situation in which they find themselves and to take collaborative approaches to those situations. (Derrington, 1999) This is done by exploring the impact decisions have made on a client’s present situation and through that exploration to find new possible choices to move forward with. Harry could have used this form of therapy in order to find resolution in any potential “what-if” moments he’d had in his past. A drawback to this is if Harry finds those memories too painful to explore and to allow to resurface.</li>
  <li>Theoretical Models<br />
    A. Review Theoretical Models<br />
    Adlerian psychology focuses on “meaning, goals, purposeful behavior, conscious action, belonging, and social interaction.” (Corey, 2016) It also emphasizes finding meaning in life and for the search for purpose in one’s own life as well as taking control over one’s own destiny, a theme unique to Adlerian therapy considering psychoanalytical approaches viewed that genetics and environment were deterministic on behavior of the person. (Corey, 2016) Existential therapy emphasizes what it means to be human and common thematic approaches common to all human life. (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, existentialism, like person-centered therapy, emphasizes the quality of the relationship between the therapist and client. These common human themes, such as the freedom of choice, is one of the basic conditions of human life that existentialism refers to with common human themes. (Corey, 2016) Person-centered therapy focuses on the quality of the relationship between the client and therapist, and believes that people have an innate drive towards self-direction. This form of therapy holds that the responsibility of the resolving of problems lies within the client. (Corey, 2016)<br />
    The strengths of the above three theoretical models may speak for themselves. Adlerian therapy emphasizes the challenging or the modifying of faulty assumptions or mistaken goals. Perhaps Harry feels responsible for the deaths of some of his close friends and feeling that he could have done something else or more in that moment to have prevented his friend’s death. Adlerian psychology would seek to correct that faulty assumption in that the therapist would attempt to convey to Harry that the events that transpired were on Harry’s part, the best that Harry could have done and that feeling responsible for the death of someone is a faulty assumption. The Adlerian therapist could provide Harry with a new “cognitive map” that would allow Harry to think more positively on his past. (Corey, 2016)<br />
    The downside to Adlerian therapy is that the relationship that I would need with Harry is that of a collaboration. At the moment it is yet unsure how much Harry will begin to trust me as a cooperative partner to help him to challenge those faulty assumptions. Part of this process begins by asking Harry to recollect early parts of his past. Harry may simply not feel that I am trustworthy enough for Harry to share some of those memories. Finally, a large portion of Adlerian theory still requires empirical data. (Corey, 2016) Therefore there may be an overlap in theory and application that is effective for Harry.<br />
    Like Adlerian theory, existentialistic theory holds that behavior and genetics are not deterministic but rather than people have the choice and freedom to decide their lives. This approach encourages clients to “reflect on life, to recognize their range of alternatives, and to decide among them.” (Corey, 2016) Harry may feel a sense that his past has determined the course of his life through the events that took place that took his parent’s life. Both Adlerian and existential theories hold that the past is not a determiner of the future and present and that Harry can take actions to take control of his destiny by first accepting responsibility of his life. According to Van Duerzen, “existential counseling is not designed to “cure” people of illness in the tradition of the medical model.” (Corey, 2016) Instead, existential counseling focuses on the “client’s immediate, ongoing experience with the aim of helping them develop a greater presence in their quest for meaning and purpose.” (Corey, 2016) Harry will soon enter into another new stage of his life, that which holds the Second Wizarding War behind him and into a life which may closely be labelled as “a civilian life.” Here Harry, though he never offered himself up as a soldier must put past the life of a soldier and now wear the clothes of a civilian. As a therapist I can encourage Harry to find greater purpose in his life as he enters into a new life.<br />
    A downside to this approach is that often times existential concepts are what might be best called “abstract.” (Corey, 2016) Those that are not philosophically minded may have a harder time grasping the principles of existentialism and may turn away from the therapy. (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, there is a larger burden of responsibility on the therapist, as “Existential therapists need to be wise and capable of profound and wide-ranging understanding of what it means to be human.” (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, “Authenticity is a cardinal characteristic of a competent existential practitioner, which is certainly more involved than mastering a body of knowledge and acquiring technical skills.” That is, do I myself have the depth of understanding of the human experience in order to fully engage Harry as a counselor? I have not experienced anywhere near the depth of his pain and struggle and can potentially find it difficult to understand Harry’s depth of emotional experience.<br />
    Person-centered therapy has a main strength that may be a drawback depending on the client. The motivational factor for change lies in the client him or herself. In particular, “This belief in the client’s capacity for self-healing is in contrast with many theories that view the therapist’s techniques as the most powerful agents that lead to change.” (Corey, 2016) Harry Potter can be seen as a survivor. The numerous events that happened in his life is evident of that. Therefore, it can be said that a person-centered therapy can beneficial to Harry since he shows the same traits that humanistic and existential theories exemplify in a human.<br />
    The downside to this is that if Harry Potter were to recede in his therapy or his will to continue on, it would become more difficult for the therapist to counsel Harry, seeing as nearly all of the theories above rely on the human’s intrinsic need to actualize. Adlerian psychology is the least humanistic of the three above theories but still relies on the client’s ability to move forward by his or her own will.</li>
</ol>

<p>B. Develop a Theoretical Orientation<br />
The three approaches of theoretical models I’ve chosen greatly emphasize the relationship between the client and the counselor. The first method I would need to utilize is the establishing of rapport with Harry. Within the three frameworks I’ve chosen, I cannot provide Harry with any sort of support and counseling without the establishment of a relationship in which I view Harry with complete faith that he can overcome his issues and that I can encourage him to do so. So, the establishment of rapport would be my first step. My second step would be to approach his past with Adlerian framework. That is, to explore his past and the overcoming of his struggles, and to explain to him that Adlerian theory, in comparison to Freudian theory, was that Adler viewed that the past was not a deterministic factor in a person, but rather that the struggles and the overcoming of the struggles was what more defined a person. Then I would utilize the existential approach by encouraging Harry to explore the other options he could have taken, past and present in order to encourage him and remind him that he has a choice in the matter of his life and that there are basic themes in his life that are universal to all human life, in order that he might be more able to empathize with the fans of his in the magical world. Then, I would utilize a person-centered therapy in order to remind Harry that it is Harry that has the ability to change himself for the present and the future. Finally, I would have him take an adaptive inventory test based on the Adlerian framework in order that Harry might have some quantitative data to take him to share with his family members, providing further another platform to discuss and to potentially grow.</p>
