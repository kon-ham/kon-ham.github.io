<meta name="description" content="Describe the Types of Characteristics That Lead to a Professional Diagnosis Although there are signs that are visible to professionals when attempting to diagnose cerebral palsy, not all of these signs are visible at birth, rather becoming more obvious as development progresses. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) And because cerebral palsy, or hereafter referred to as CP, ranges in severity of disorder – often times there is instead a spectrum of conditions in the diagnosis of CP. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Children are usually generally screened at 9, 18, and 24 months. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Pediatricians usually watch for delays in motor function relating to the child’s ability to hold his or her head up, rolling over, visual alertness, sitting, crawling, walking, and picking up small objects. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) The pediatrician may check for signs such as if the baby has low muscle tone (the baby feels floppy), the baby being unable to hold up his or her own head when lying stomach down or in a supported sitting position (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), muscle spasms or feeling stiff (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), poor muscle control as well as reflexes as posture (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), delayed development relating to motor functions (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), issues with feeding or swallowing (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), and the preference to use one side of the body. Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder meaning that the disorder does not becoming worse over time. (Nordqvist, 2017) Rather, quality of life can improve once treatment through therapy is applied. (Nordqvist, 2017) Often times these babies are born on time instead of being born prematurely. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) So time varies for when an infant is diagnosed with CP. However, a “General Movements Assessment can be conducted from birth until 5 months of age.” (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) This assessment can indicate whether or not a child as CP but it cannot indicate the severity of CP. Discuss the Stages of Development in Which These Characteristics Emerge Because CP is not a progressive disorder and does not worsen over time as children reach adulthood, there is no stage of development. (Nordqvist, 2017) However, as mentioned earlier, these stages of development may appear to worsen as a child with mild CP may have delayed developmental milestones, which would to a parent, appear to be in some sort of way progressive. So rather than the disorder developing over a period of time, it is the appearance of the disorders that becomes more visible as the child reaches what should be normal developmental milestones that a parent begins to suspect something is wrong if the severity of the disorder is not great. So, children with varying conditions may reach certain developmental milestones with the use of therapy and interventions, (Loop, 2016) or they may never reach certain milestones at all, if the depth of damage to the brain is great. (Loop, 2016) Provide an analysis and comparison of at least 4 current intervention practices related to this disability First, a point should be made about the spectrum of conditions that CP affects in people. CP has many different conditions and affects every person differently. Though the definition of cerebral palsy is clear, which is that it is “a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damaged that occurs to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth”, the symptoms and depth of damage varies greatly. And in many cases, the depth exact trigger is unknown. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some affected with CP are able to walk while some are unable to walk. The same applies for cognitive ability. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some with CP are affected with blindness, deafness, and epilepsy. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) So this makes treatment and intervention of this disorder to be varied greatly and highly dependent on an individual case. Here I will describe four examples of therapy but it should be noted that these methods once again are dependent on a case by case basis. First is physical therapy. Physical therapy focuses on the motor functions of the child and seeks to improve specific abilities which could include “the child’s posture, sensory processing, muscle tone, and coordination, developmental skills, and adaptive equipment.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) Because one of the many symptoms of CP affects the body’s ability to control motor function, physical therapy looks to improve the motor function through strength training and muscle development through resistance training. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Physical therapy also can involve providing for the child a stroller, a wheelchair, and even car seats. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Coordination is also sought to be improved upon, since CP affects the muscle’s ability to function correctly. The second intervention and therapy method is occupational therapy. While physical therapy seeks to improve the motor function and physical aspects of a person with CP, occupational therapy focuses on “the whole being” (CP Daily Living, 2016) so that a person with CP can live a fulfilling life to the best of their abilities. For example, basic tools like being able to feed oneself and the ability to use scissors are instead replaced with the help of an occupational therapist with specialized feeding utensils and adaptive scissors. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Both physical therapy and occupational therapy are similar in that they both first conduct an evaluation to determine the potential of ability in the person. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Based on this comprehensive evaluation, occupational and physical therapists then provide targeted training to further develop a person with CP. They are both similar in that while sometimes occupation and physical therapy can be an intensive method, they are usually designed to be fun and stimulating for the child. The third method is constraint induced movement therapy, or CIMT. CIMT deals with individuals that have impairment on one side of the body that is greater than the other. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Often times these individuals learn “non-use” of their more impaired limb because they neglect that limb in favor of the more functional limb. (CP Daily Living, 2016) So CIMT seeks to improve “the activity level and usage of the impaired limb.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This therapy was first developed in the early 1900s with the use of experiments of monkeys. It was used in the 1960’s with stroke patients. But only recently with the advancement in the theories of brain plasticity has CIMT become a much more influential tool in the use of individuals with CP and others, like stroke victims. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The potential negative to CIMT is that whereas CIMT focuses on the use of the single, more impaired limb, bimanual training focuses on the use of both limbs in coordination together with the theory that because the brain uses both sides of the brain’s hemisphere to move limbs, potentially using only one limb to train the brain may lose ability to inhibit one side of the brain and prohibit new connections from forming on the uninjured side. (CP Daily Living, 2016) While studies have found that both bimanual training and CIMT have produced statistically significant improvements in the use of the limbs of patients with CP, the downside of this therapy is that it is intensive on both the child and the parent. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The fourth method is speech-language therapy. Because the spectrum of severity of CP is wide and varied, often times along with motor function disabilities a person with CP could also be affected with speech disabilities. Speech-language therapy, or SLP, evaluates “communication skills” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and treats “speech and language disorders” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and includes “receptive and expressive language, auditory processing, memory, articulation, and phonological training.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This method focuses on those with articulation disorders, fluency disorders, resonance or voice disorders, or dysphagia or oral feeding disorders. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Sometimes the use of computers aids in the therapy, or, if the disorder is severe and the patient is unable to speak completely, different means of communications may be developed, like the use of sign language or the use of voice output communication devices. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Summarize at least 2 educational theories that can be applied to the improvement of special education in the context of your selected disability Personalization is the educational theory of “tailoring services to meet the unique goals and aspirations of a child and that of a child’s family so that the child can reach his or her full potential.” (Patten, 2018) Specifically, personalization of the classroom environment is important for those with CP because CP is a wide and varied disorder. The needs of each child are different. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) So with those with CP, there will need to be a wide variety of accommodations to be made so that the classroom is personalized in a manner that allows the child with CP to reach his or her goals. Examples of this include making sure there is enough space in the classroom to ensure the child with CP can get around the classroom. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) Because the child with CP may not be cognitively inhibited, though outwardly he or she may look disabled, the cognitive processes are somewhat normal. This means that the child is still a child. He or she may want to be involved in the process making friends, being included in the classroom, and being involving in the various activities that revolve around the classroom. As such, teachers can be involved in the personalization process by making sure that the student with CP can receive enough opportunities to stimulate his or her mind as much as a student without any disabilities would receive. The second theory is the theory of inclusion, which is the “idea of education students both with and without disabilities together within classes at local schools.” (Patten, 2018) This idea is critical to those that suffer with CP and like mentioned earlier, may not actually be cognitively disabled as he or she is physically disabled. Inclusion can help the child feel and to know he or she is making progress in his or her life through the use of integration of the disabled student and those without disabilities. Teachers could in this manner expose students to awareness about CP and even foster new types of friendships with the child with CP disability. Outline the history and laws specific to the disability Cerebral palsy is as old as the Egyptians. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Though even the Greeks and Romans knew of cerebral palsy, like us now, they did not know how to cure it. In the 1830’s, a surgeon named William John Little made headway into the study of cerebral palsy. It was at this time not known as cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1853, Little published a study titled “On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In it, he wrote a description of cerebral palsy with the name of “pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1861, Little attempted to define cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) At this time the disorder was known as Little’s Disease. What’s important to note here is that Little wrote about “the importance of early treatment and intervention.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Furthermore, he wrote about how “the children have been “restored to considerable activity and enjoyment of life.”” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1889, Sir William Osler wrote a book titled “Cerebral Palsies of Children.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1897 Sigmund Freud proposed that cerebral palsy was a disorder that formed before childbirth. This view contrasted with Sir William Osler and William John Little. Furthermore, Freud also associated “intellectual disabilities, visual disturbances, and seizures with cerebral palsy.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1949 the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is founded. Leonard Goldenson and his wife Isabelle along with Jack Hausman and his wife Ethel founded the organization because both couples were parents to children with cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1963 President John F. Kennedy signs the Community Mental Health Act. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Around the 1980’s, research is proven to the credit of Sigmund Freud in that cerebral palsy is formed before birth. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed, forbidding employers from discriminating those with disabilities. The Learning Environment I envision working with ages that relate to grades 1-5 which is traditionally known as elementary school. In this environment, there is an inclusive environment of both disabled and nondisabled children. It is a public school, so I must not only learn to work with my student, who has cerebral palsy, as a special needs teacher, but also to work with the main teacher in the classroom. The first strategy I would employ would be to work with the main teacher in providing ways to create an inclusive environment concerning the curriculum of the classroom. In a classroom of more than 25 students, it is understandable that the children without disabilities would take priority in terms of course curriculum preference. However, I would attempt to design ways to inject material into the main course curriculum that would provide for in terms of inclusion for my student who has cerebral palsy. Second, I would seek the advice of the main teacher as well as the other special needs teacher in order to get better insight into the overall program of not only just my student but also the students of the entire school. I would seek the council of the other more experienced teachers in order to better serve the needs of my special needs student. Third, I would also request from the main teacher an opportunity to make small adjustments in the classroom which would enable my student with CP to be better equipped to move around in the classroom, as my student could likely be wheel chair bound. Fourth and finally, I would also maintain close contact with my student’s other therapists and interventionists in order to fully maintain optimal progress with his or her own levels of achievement outside of the classroom. March of Dimes is an organization that seeks to raise awareness of CP. Not only can you find information related to CP on the website, but you can also attend events related to your zip code that will put you in contact with other advocates and those who have friends or family members that are diagnosed with CP. Having a support group is incredibly important for those members that have CP and members that are related to those with CP. March of Dimes is a large organization that aggregates information of events related to CP. Finding closer friends and new family members to help support my student would only be a zip code entry away. Second, I would recommend looking into the professionals that reside in my student’s local area that specializes in CP. A quick search through Google reveals that in this hypothetical situation, my student lives in Galveston, Texas and there is a local doctor that specializes in CP. His name is David A. Yngve, MD. Being able to know who the professionals are, medically, will be of major assistance to my student because there are things that are constantly developing in the field of medicine and someone like Doctor Yngve could point my student to a new direction concerning therapy and intervention. Furthermore, mothers and fathers could keep in touch with Doctor Yngve and he could also provide further information for coping and raising a child with CP such as my student. A service I would not recommend is, according to my student’s local area, is the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children in Galveston Texas. Because I have a belief in inclusion of students with disabilities into a regular classroom with students that have no disabilities, I believe that segregating a student with CP with other students that have CP is, though I’m sure he or she would receive more specialized training, of no benefit to not only my student that has a special need, but also to the students without CP. My student would be a beacon of awareness to the other students without a disability. And my view is that because there are so many options and potentials, perhaps one of my students without a disability will one day grow up to become a doctor that would specialize in CP. And perhaps my student that has CP would also one day grow up to be a doctor that specializes in CP. But because I view that inclusion is of the highest priority in students with disabilities, I would recommend against sending my student with CP to the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children. In my ideal schedule I would have my student with CP to have a separate, more focused learning classroom that gives me one on one time with him or her. Here I am focusing on building skills relating to his or her specific disabilities and am working around or building up on those disabilities. So, from the start of the school day, from 8 until 9:45, I have my own alone time with my student. Furthermore, I am also teaching the same curriculum that my coworker, the main teacher that focuses on the children without the disabilities, has planned with me together from weeks previously. And then from 10:00 to 11:30, my student spends the rest of his or her time with the rest of the class. I have already coordinated with my other coworker, the main teacher that teaches the children without CP and the bulk of the information that needs to be taught on an normal pace is already taught, and from 10:00 to 11:30PM the main teacher focuses on inclusion of my special needs student into the regular classroom schedule. Once lunch begins at 11:30 and ends at 12:30, it is then that we return to the main classroom in an inclusive environment with the other students, until 2:30, which is 30 minutes before school ends. My special needs student and I depart from the classroom earlier in order to avoid the rush of the students leaving because my special needs student with CP could have a physical disability which could slow down the other students or even potentially injure him or herself from the other students rushing out of the classroom. Because the classroom is spaced out in such a manner that my student, who could be in a wheel chair, can easily leave the classroom without much of a distraction, the other students are not very much aware of myself and my special needs student departing. My special needs student, who could be anywhere from ages 5-12 will be experiencing what is known as the Industry vs. Inferiority stage of Erik Erikson. In this stage teachers become more important as do the peers of the child. (Mcleod, 2013) Children begin to feel a sense of accomplishment in their competencies. (Mcleod, 2013) My special needs student may have major limitations which may inhibit this part of the development. This is why I will focus on developing his or her ability to write, if he or she cannot speak fluently due to a lack of motor control, so that he or she can begin to feel that they can express themselves freely, if not by their mouths but by their minds. Second, I will focus on developing a specific curriculum that emphasizes something physical. So that no matter his or her physical limitations, some sense of autonomy can be achieved through little exercises, dependent upon her or her limitations. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) Third, I would focus on building the students idea of self-image. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) At this age that self-image can be shaky, even in a normally developing child. I would work on finding ways to build an alternative self-image, specifically through the use of a blog and social media, where a student can be a different person in a limitless universe that is the internet. Of course, this would be with the parent’s permission. Finally, I would always speak on eye level with my student if he or she were in a wheel chair to promote a sense of equal footing with myself and my student. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) All activities would be performed on this level. Finally, it could be that my student is not originally an English speaker. I would provide for a translator for when I need to speak with his or her parents and to also attempt to learn basic commands and praises in that language so that some sense of communication occurs in a meaningful way. It could be that this student not only is involved in my special needs class but also an English as a Second Language course in which he or she is learning English as well as attempting to perform in a regular English speaking classroom, so not only would I attempt to learn basic language skills of that student’s proficiency but to also coordinate with the ESL teacher in order to better improve and progress their skills to perform adequately.

(Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In it, he wrote a description of cerebral palsy with the name of “pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1861, Little attempted to define cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) At this time the disorder was known as Little’s Disease. What’s important to note here is that Little wrote about “the importance of early treatment and intervention.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Furthermore, he wrote about how “the children have been “restored to considerable activity and enjoyment of life.”” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1889, Sir William Osler wrote a book titled “Cerebral Palsies of Children.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1897 Sigmund Freud proposed that cerebral palsy was a disorder that formed before childbirth. This view contrasted with Sir William Osler and William John Little. Furthermore, Freud also associated “intellectual disabilities, visual disturbances, and seizures with cerebral palsy.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1949 the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is founded. Leonard Goldenson and his wife Isabelle along with Jack Hausman and his wife Ethel founded the organization because both couples were parents to children with cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1963 President John F. Kennedy signs the Community Mental Health Act. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Around the 1980’s, research is proven to the credit of Sigmund Freud in that cerebral palsy is formed before birth. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed, forbidding employers from discriminating those with disabilities. The Learning Environment I envision working with ages that relate to grades 1-5 which is traditionally known as elementary school. In this environment, there is an inclusive environment of both disabled and nondisabled children. It is a public school, so I must not only learn to work with my student, who has cerebral palsy, as a special needs teacher, but also to work with the main teacher in the classroom. The first strategy I would employ would be to work with the main teacher in providing ways to create an inclusive environment concerning the curriculum of the classroom. In a classroom of more than 25 students, it is understandable that the children without disabilities would take priority in terms of course curriculum preference. However, I would attempt to design ways to inject material into the main course curriculum that would provide for in terms of inclusion for my student who has cerebral palsy. Second, I would seek the advice of the main teacher as well as the other special needs teacher in order to get better insight into the overall program of not only just my student but also the students of the entire school. I would seek the council of the other more experienced teachers in order to better serve the needs of my special needs student. Third, I would also request from the main teacher an opportunity to make small adjustments in the classroom which would enable my student with CP to be better equipped to move around in the classroom, as my student could likely be wheel chair bound. Fourth and finally, I would also maintain close contact with my student’s other therapists and interventionists in order to fully maintain optimal progress with his or her own levels of achievement outside of the classroom. March of Dimes is an organization that seeks to raise awareness of CP. Not only can you find information related to CP on the website, but you can also attend events related to your zip code that will put you in contact with other advocates and those who have friends or family members that are diagnosed with CP. Having a support group is incredibly important for those members that have CP and members that are related to those with CP. March of Dimes is a large organization that aggregates information of events related to CP. Finding closer friends and new family members to help support my student would only be a zip code entry away. Second, I would recommend looking into the professionals that reside in my student’s local area that specializes in CP. A quick search through Google reveals that in this hypothetical situation, my student lives in Galveston, Texas and there is a local doctor that specializes in CP. His name is David A. Yngve, MD. Being able to know who the professionals are, medically, will be of major assistance to my student because there are things that are constantly developing in the field of medicine and someone like Doctor Yngve could point my student to a new direction concerning therapy and intervention. Furthermore, mothers and fathers could keep in touch with Doctor Yngve and he could also provide further information for coping and raising a child with CP such as my student. A service I would not recommend is, according to my student’s local area, is the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children in Galveston Texas. Because I have a belief in inclusion of students with disabilities into a regular classroom with students that have no disabilities, I believe that segregating a student with CP with other students that have CP is, though I’m sure he or she would receive more specialized training, of no benefit to not only my student that has a special need, but also to the students without CP. My student would be a beacon of awareness to the other students without a disability. And my view is that because there are so many options and potentials, perhaps one of my students without a disability will one day grow up to become a doctor that would specialize in CP. And perhaps my student that has CP would also one day grow up to be a doctor that specializes in CP. But because I view that inclusion is of the highest priority in students with disabilities, I would recommend against sending my student with CP to the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children. In my ideal schedule I would have my student with CP to have a separate, more focused learning classroom that gives me one on one time with him or her. Here I am focusing on building skills relating to his or her specific disabilities and am working around or building up on those disabilities. So, from the start of the school day, from 8 until 9:45, I have my own alone time with my student. Furthermore, I am also teaching the same curriculum that my coworker, the main teacher that focuses on the children without the disabilities, has planned with me together from weeks previously. And then from 10:00 to 11:30, my student spends the rest of his or her time with the rest of the class. I have already coordinated with my other coworker, the main teacher that teaches the children without CP and the bulk of the information that needs to be taught on an normal pace is already taught, and from 10:00 to 11:30PM the main teacher focuses on inclusion of my special needs student into the regular classroom schedule. Once lunch begins at 11:30 and ends at 12:30, it is then that we return to the main classroom in an inclusive environment with the other students, until 2:30, which is 30 minutes before school ends. My special needs student and I depart from the classroom earlier in order to avoid the rush of the students leaving because my special needs student with CP could have a physical disability which could slow down the other students or even potentially injure him or herself from the other students rushing out of the classroom. Because the classroom is spaced out in such a manner that my student, who could be in a wheel chair, can easily leave the classroom without much of a distraction, the other students are not very much aware of myself and my special needs student departing. My special needs student, who could be anywhere from ages 5-12 will be experiencing what is known as the Industry vs. Inferiority stage of Erik Erikson. In this stage teachers become more important as do the peers of the child. (Mcleod, 2013) Children begin to feel a sense of accomplishment in their competencies. (Mcleod, 2013) My special needs student may have major limitations which may inhibit this part of the development. This is why I will focus on developing his or her ability to write, if he or she cannot speak fluently due to a lack of motor control, so that he or she can begin to feel that they can express themselves freely, if not by their mouths but by their minds. Second, I will focus on developing a specific curriculum that emphasizes something physical. So that no matter his or her physical limitations, some sense of autonomy can be achieved through little exercises, dependent upon her or her limitations. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) Third, I would focus on building the students idea of self-image. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) At this age that self-image can be shaky, even in a normally developing child. I would work on finding ways to build an alternative self-image, specifically through the use of a blog and social media, where a student can be a different person in a limitless universe that is the internet. Of course, this would be with the parent’s permission. Finally, I would always speak on eye level with my student if he or she were in a wheel chair to promote a sense of equal footing with myself and my student. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) All activities would be performed on this level. Finally, it could be that my student is not originally an English speaker. I would provide for a translator for when I need to speak with his or her parents and to also attempt to learn basic commands and praises in that language so that some sense of communication occurs in a meaningful way. It could be that this student not only is involved in my special needs class but also an English as a Second Language course in which he or she is learning English as well as attempting to perform in a regular English speaking classroom, so not only would I attempt to learn basic language skills of that student’s proficiency but to also coordinate with the ESL teacher in order to better improve and progress their skills to perform adequately.

{"@type":"BlogPosting","description":"Describe the Types of Characteristics That Lead to a Professional Diagnosis Although there are signs that are visible to professionals when attempting to diagnose cerebral palsy, not all of these signs are visible at birth, rather becoming more obvious as development progresses. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) And because cerebral palsy, or hereafter referred to as CP, ranges in severity of disorder – often times there is instead a spectrum of conditions in the diagnosis of CP. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Children are usually generally screened at 9, 18, and 24 months. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Pediatricians usually watch for delays in motor function relating to the child’s ability to hold his or her head up, rolling over, visual alertness, sitting, crawling, walking, and picking up small objects. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) The pediatrician may check for signs such as if the baby has low muscle tone (the baby feels floppy), the baby being unable to hold up his or her own head when lying stomach down or in a supported sitting position (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), muscle spasms or feeling stiff (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), poor muscle control as well as reflexes as posture (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), delayed development relating to motor functions (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), issues with feeding or swallowing (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), and the preference to use one side of the body. Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder meaning that the disorder does not becoming worse over time. (Nordqvist, 2017) Rather, quality of life can improve once treatment through therapy is applied. (Nordqvist, 2017) Often times these babies are born on time instead of being born prematurely. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) So time varies for when an infant is diagnosed with CP. However, a “General Movements Assessment can be conducted from birth until 5 months of age.” (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) This assessment can indicate whether or not a child as CP but it cannot indicate the severity of CP. Discuss the Stages of Development in Which These Characteristics Emerge Because CP is not a progressive disorder and does not worsen over time as children reach adulthood, there is no stage of development. (Nordqvist, 2017) However, as mentioned earlier, these stages of development may appear to worsen as a child with mild CP may have delayed developmental milestones, which would to a parent, appear to be in some sort of way progressive. So rather than the disorder developing over a period of time, it is the appearance of the disorders that becomes more visible as the child reaches what should be normal developmental milestones that a parent begins to suspect something is wrong if the severity of the disorder is not great. So, children with varying conditions may reach certain developmental milestones with the use of therapy and interventions, (Loop, 2016) or they may never reach certain milestones at all, if the depth of damage to the brain is great. (Loop, 2016) Provide an analysis and comparison of at least 4 current intervention practices related to this disability First, a point should be made about the spectrum of conditions that CP affects in people. CP has many different conditions and affects every person differently. Though the definition of cerebral palsy is clear, which is that it is “a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damaged that occurs to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth”, the symptoms and depth of damage varies greatly. And in many cases, the depth exact trigger is unknown. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some affected with CP are able to walk while some are unable to walk. The same applies for cognitive ability. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some with CP are affected with blindness, deafness, and epilepsy. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) So this makes treatment and intervention of this disorder to be varied greatly and highly dependent on an individual case. Here I will describe four examples of therapy but it should be noted that these methods once again are dependent on a case by case basis. First is physical therapy. Physical therapy focuses on the motor functions of the child and seeks to improve specific abilities which could include “the child’s posture, sensory processing, muscle tone, and coordination, developmental skills, and adaptive equipment.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) Because one of the many symptoms of CP affects the body’s ability to control motor function, physical therapy looks to improve the motor function through strength training and muscle development through resistance training. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Physical therapy also can involve providing for the child a stroller, a wheelchair, and even car seats. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Coordination is also sought to be improved upon, since CP affects the muscle’s ability to function correctly. The second intervention and therapy method is occupational therapy. While physical therapy seeks to improve the motor function and physical aspects of a person with CP, occupational therapy focuses on “the whole being” (CP Daily Living, 2016) so that a person with CP can live a fulfilling life to the best of their abilities. For example, basic tools like being able to feed oneself and the ability to use scissors are instead replaced with the help of an occupational therapist with specialized feeding utensils and adaptive scissors. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Both physical therapy and occupational therapy are similar in that they both first conduct an evaluation to determine the potential of ability in the person. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Based on this comprehensive evaluation, occupational and physical therapists then provide targeted training to further develop a person with CP. They are both similar in that while sometimes occupation and physical therapy can be an intensive method, they are usually designed to be fun and stimulating for the child. The third method is constraint induced movement therapy, or CIMT. CIMT deals with individuals that have impairment on one side of the body that is greater than the other. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Often times these individuals learn “non-use” of their more impaired limb because they neglect that limb in favor of the more functional limb. (CP Daily Living, 2016) So CIMT seeks to improve “the activity level and usage of the impaired limb.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This therapy was first developed in the early 1900s with the use of experiments of monkeys. It was used in the 1960’s with stroke patients. But only recently with the advancement in the theories of brain plasticity has CIMT become a much more influential tool in the use of individuals with CP and others, like stroke victims. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The potential negative to CIMT is that whereas CIMT focuses on the use of the single, more impaired limb, bimanual training focuses on the use of both limbs in coordination together with the theory that because the brain uses both sides of the brain’s hemisphere to move limbs, potentially using only one limb to train the brain may lose ability to inhibit one side of the brain and prohibit new connections from forming on the uninjured side. (CP Daily Living, 2016) While studies have found that both bimanual training and CIMT have produced statistically significant improvements in the use of the limbs of patients with CP, the downside of this therapy is that it is intensive on both the child and the parent. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The fourth method is speech-language therapy. Because the spectrum of severity of CP is wide and varied, often times along with motor function disabilities a person with CP could also be affected with speech disabilities. Speech-language therapy, or SLP, evaluates “communication skills” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and treats “speech and language disorders” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and includes “receptive and expressive language, auditory processing, memory, articulation, and phonological training.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This method focuses on those with articulation disorders, fluency disorders, resonance or voice disorders, or dysphagia or oral feeding disorders. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Sometimes the use of computers aids in the therapy, or, if the disorder is severe and the patient is unable to speak completely, different means of communications may be developed, like the use of sign language or the use of voice output communication devices. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Summarize at least 2 educational theories that can be applied to the improvement of special education in the context of your selected disability Personalization is the educational theory of “tailoring services to meet the unique goals and aspirations of a child and that of a child’s family so that the child can reach his or her full potential.” (Patten, 2018) Specifically, personalization of the classroom environment is important for those with CP because CP is a wide and varied disorder. The needs of each child are different. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) So with those with CP, there will need to be a wide variety of accommodations to be made so that the classroom is personalized in a manner that allows the child with CP to reach his or her goals. Examples of this include making sure there is enough space in the classroom to ensure the child with CP can get around the classroom. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) Because the child with CP may not be cognitively inhibited, though outwardly he or she may look disabled, the cognitive processes are somewhat normal. This means that the child is still a child. He or she may want to be involved in the process making friends, being included in the classroom, and being involving in the various activities that revolve around the classroom. As such, teachers can be involved in the personalization process by making sure that the student with CP can receive enough opportunities to stimulate his or her mind as much as a student without any disabilities would receive. The second theory is the theory of inclusion, which is the “idea of education students both with and without disabilities together within classes at local schools.” (Patten, 2018) This idea is critical to those that suffer with CP and like mentioned earlier, may not actually be cognitively disabled as he or she is physically disabled. Inclusion can help the child feel and to know he or she is making progress in his or her life through the use of integration of the disabled student and those without disabilities. Teachers could in this manner expose students to awareness about CP and even foster new types of friendships with the child with CP disability. Outline the history and laws specific to the disability Cerebral palsy is as old as the Egyptians. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Though even the Greeks and Romans knew of cerebral palsy, like us now, they did not know how to cure it. In the 1830’s, a surgeon named William John Little made headway into the study of cerebral palsy. It was at this time not known as cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1853, Little published a study titled “On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame”.

This view contrasted with Sir William Osler and William John Little. Furthermore, Freud also associated “intellectual disabilities, visual disturbances, and seizures with cerebral palsy.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1949 the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is founded. Leonard Goldenson and his wife Isabelle along with Jack Hausman and his wife Ethel founded the organization because both couples were parents to children with cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1963 President John F. Kennedy signs the Community Mental Health Act. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Around the 1980’s, research is proven to the credit of Sigmund Freud in that cerebral palsy is formed before birth. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed, forbidding employers from discriminating those with disabilities. The Learning Environment I envision working with ages that relate to grades 1-5 which is traditionally known as elementary school. In this environment, there is an inclusive environment of both disabled and nondisabled children. It is a public school, so I must not only learn to work with my student, who has cerebral palsy, as a special needs teacher, but also to work with the main teacher in the classroom. The first strategy I would employ would be to work with the main teacher in providing ways to create an inclusive environment concerning the curriculum of the classroom. In a classroom of more than 25 students, it is understandable that the children without disabilities would take priority in terms of course curriculum preference. However, I would attempt to design ways to inject material into the main course curriculum that would provide for in terms of inclusion for my student who has cerebral palsy.

  <p>Describe the Types of Characteristics That Lead to a Professional Diagnosis<br />
Although there are signs that are visible to professionals when attempting to diagnose cerebral palsy, not all of these signs are visible at birth, rather becoming more obvious as development progresses. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) And because cerebral palsy, or hereafter referred to as CP, ranges in severity of disorder – often times there is instead a spectrum of conditions in the diagnosis of CP. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Children are usually generally screened at 9, 18, and 24 months. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Pediatricians usually watch for delays in motor function relating to the child’s ability to hold his or her head up, rolling over, visual alertness, sitting, crawling, walking, and picking up small objects. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) The pediatrician may check for signs such as if the baby has low muscle tone (the baby feels floppy), the baby being unable to hold up his or her own head when lying stomach down or in a supported sitting position (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), muscle spasms or feeling stiff (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), poor muscle control as well as reflexes as posture (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), delayed development relating to motor functions (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), issues with feeding or swallowing (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), and the preference to use one side of the body. Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder meaning that the disorder does not becoming worse over time. (Nordqvist, 2017) Rather, quality of life can improve once treatment through therapy is applied. (Nordqvist, 2017) Often times these babies are born on time instead of being born prematurely. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) So time varies for when an infant is diagnosed with CP. However, a “General Movements Assessment can be conducted from birth until 5 months of age.” (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) This assessment can indicate whether or not a child as CP but it cannot indicate the severity of CP.<br />
Discuss the Stages of Development in Which These Characteristics Emerge<br />
Because CP is not a progressive disorder and does not worsen over time as children reach adulthood, there is no stage of development. (Nordqvist, 2017) However, as mentioned earlier, these stages of development may appear to worsen as a child with mild CP may have delayed developmental milestones, which would to a parent, appear to be in some sort of way progressive. So rather than the disorder developing over a period of time, it is the appearance of the disorders that becomes more visible as the child reaches what should be normal developmental milestones that a parent begins to suspect something is wrong if the severity of the disorder is not great. So, children with varying conditions may reach certain developmental milestones with the use of therapy and interventions, (Loop, 2016) or they may never reach certain milestones at all, if the depth of damage to the brain is great. (Loop, 2016)<br />
Provide an analysis and comparison of at least 4 current intervention practices related to this disability<br />
First, a point should be made about the spectrum of conditions that CP affects in people. CP has many different conditions and affects every person differently. Though the definition of cerebral palsy is clear, which is that it is “a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damaged that occurs to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth”, the symptoms and depth of damage varies greatly. And in many cases, the depth exact trigger is unknown. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some affected with CP are able to walk while some are unable to walk. The same applies for cognitive ability. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some with CP are affected with blindness, deafness, and epilepsy. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) So this makes treatment and intervention of this disorder to be varied greatly and highly dependent on an individual case. Here I will describe four examples of therapy but it should be noted that these methods once again are dependent on a case by case basis.<br />
First is physical therapy. Physical therapy focuses on the motor functions of the child and seeks to improve specific abilities which could include “the child’s posture, sensory processing, muscle tone, and coordination, developmental skills, and adaptive equipment.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) Because one of the many symptoms of CP affects the body’s ability to control motor function, physical therapy looks to improve the motor function through strength training and muscle development through resistance training. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Physical therapy also can involve providing for the child a stroller, a wheelchair, and even car seats. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Coordination is also sought to be improved upon, since CP affects the muscle’s ability to function correctly.<br />
The second intervention and therapy method is occupational therapy. While physical therapy seeks to improve the motor function and physical aspects of a person with CP, occupational therapy focuses on “the whole being” (CP Daily Living, 2016) so that a person with CP can live a fulfilling life to the best of their abilities. For example, basic tools like being able to feed oneself and the ability to use scissors are instead replaced with the help of an occupational therapist with specialized feeding utensils and adaptive scissors. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Both physical therapy and occupational therapy are similar in that they both first conduct an evaluation to determine the potential of ability in the person. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Based on this comprehensive evaluation, occupational and physical therapists then provide targeted training to further develop a person with CP. They are both similar in that while sometimes occupation and physical therapy can be an intensive method, they are usually designed to be fun and stimulating for the child.<br />
The third method is constraint induced movement therapy, or CIMT. CIMT deals with individuals that have impairment on one side of the body that is greater than the other. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Often times these individuals learn “non-use” of their more impaired limb because they neglect that limb in favor of the more functional limb. (CP Daily Living, 2016) So CIMT seeks to improve “the activity level and usage of the impaired limb.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This therapy was first developed in the early 1900s with the use of experiments of monkeys. It was used in the 1960’s with stroke patients. But only recently with the advancement in the theories of brain plasticity has CIMT become a much more influential tool in the use of individuals with CP and others, like stroke victims. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The potential negative to CIMT is that whereas CIMT focuses on the use of the single, more impaired limb, bimanual training focuses on the use of both limbs in coordination together with the theory that because the brain uses both sides of the brain’s hemisphere to move limbs, potentially using only one limb to train the brain may lose ability to inhibit one side of the brain and prohibit new connections from forming on the uninjured side. (CP Daily Living, 2016) While studies have found that both bimanual training and CIMT have produced statistically significant improvements in the use of the limbs of patients with CP, the downside of this therapy is that it is intensive on both the child and the parent. (CP Daily Living, 2016)<br />
The fourth method is speech-language therapy. Because the spectrum of severity of CP is wide and varied, often times along with motor function disabilities a person with CP could also be affected with speech disabilities. Speech-language therapy, or SLP, evaluates “communication skills” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and treats “speech and language disorders” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and includes “receptive and expressive language, auditory processing, memory, articulation, and phonological training.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This method focuses on those with articulation disorders, fluency disorders, resonance or voice disorders, or dysphagia or oral feeding disorders. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Sometimes the use of computers aids in the therapy, or, if the disorder is severe and the patient is unable to speak completely, different means of communications may be developed, like the use of sign language or the use of voice output communication devices. (CP Daily Living, 2016)<br />
Summarize at least 2 educational theories that can be applied to the improvement of special education in the context of your selected disability<br />
Personalization is the educational theory of “tailoring services to meet the unique goals and aspirations of a child and that of a child’s family so that the child can reach his or her full potential.” (Patten, 2018) Specifically, personalization of the classroom environment is important for those with CP because CP is a wide and varied disorder. The needs of each child are different. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) So with those with CP, there will need to be a wide variety of accommodations to be made so that the classroom is personalized in a manner that allows the child with CP to reach his or her goals. Examples of this include making sure there is enough space in the classroom to ensure the child with CP can get around the classroom. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) Because the child with CP may not be cognitively inhibited, though outwardly he or she may look disabled, the cognitive processes are somewhat normal. This means that the child is still a child. He or she may want to be involved in the process making friends, being included in the classroom, and being involving in the various activities that revolve around the classroom. As such, teachers can be involved in the personalization process by making sure that the student with CP can receive enough opportunities to stimulate his or her mind as much as a student without any disabilities would receive. The second theory is the theory of inclusion, which is the “idea of education students both with and without disabilities together within classes at local schools.” (Patten, 2018) This idea is critical to those that suffer with CP and like mentioned earlier, may not actually be cognitively disabled as he or she is physically disabled. Inclusion can help the child feel and to know he or she is making progress in his or her life through the use of integration of the disabled student and those without disabilities. Teachers could in this manner expose students to awareness about CP and even foster new types of friendships with the child with CP disability.<br />
Outline the history and laws specific to the disability<br />
Cerebral palsy is as old as the Egyptians. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Though even the Greeks and Romans knew of cerebral palsy, like us now, they did not know how to cure it. In the 1830’s, a surgeon named William John Little made headway into the study of cerebral palsy. It was at this time not known as cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1853, Little published a study titled “On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In it, he wrote a description of cerebral palsy with the name of “pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1861, Little attempted to define cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) At this time the disorder was known as Little’s Disease. What’s important to note here is that Little wrote about “the importance of early treatment and intervention.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Furthermore, he wrote about how “the children have been “restored to considerable activity and enjoyment of life.”” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1889, Sir William Osler wrote a book titled “Cerebral Palsies of Children.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1897 Sigmund Freud proposed that cerebral palsy was a disorder that formed before childbirth. This view contrasted with Sir William Osler and William John Little. Furthermore, Freud also associated “intellectual disabilities, visual disturbances, and seizures with cerebral palsy.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1949 the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is founded. Leonard Goldenson and his wife Isabelle along with Jack Hausman and his wife Ethel founded the organization because both couples were parents to children with cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1963 President John F. Kennedy signs the Community Mental Health Act. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Around the 1980’s, research is proven to the credit of Sigmund Freud in that cerebral palsy is formed before birth. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed, forbidding employers from discriminating those with disabilities.<br />
The Learning Environment<br />
I envision working with ages that relate to grades 1-5 which is traditionally known as elementary school. In this environment, there is an inclusive environment of both disabled and nondisabled children. It is a public school, so I must not only learn to work with my student, who has cerebral palsy, as a special needs teacher, but also to work with the main teacher in the classroom. The first strategy I would employ would be to work with the main teacher in providing ways to create an inclusive environment concerning the curriculum of the classroom. In a classroom of more than 25 students, it is understandable that the children without disabilities would take priority in terms of course curriculum preference. However, I would attempt to design ways to inject material into the main course curriculum that would provide for in terms of inclusion for my student who has cerebral palsy. Second, I would seek the advice of the main teacher as well as the other special needs teacher in order to get better insight into the overall program of not only just my student but also the students of the entire school. I would seek the council of the other more experienced teachers in order to better serve the needs of my special needs student. Third, I would also request from the main teacher an opportunity to make small adjustments in the classroom which would enable my student with CP to be better equipped to move around in the classroom, as my student could likely be wheel chair bound. Fourth and finally, I would also maintain close contact with my student’s other therapists and interventionists in order to fully maintain optimal progress with his or her own levels of achievement outside of the classroom.<br />
March of Dimes is an organization that seeks to raise awareness of CP. Not only can you find information related to CP on the website, but you can also attend events related to your zip code that will put you in contact with other advocates and those who have friends or family members that are diagnosed with CP. Having a support group is incredibly important for those members that have CP and members that are related to those with CP. March of Dimes is a large organization that aggregates information of events related to CP. Finding closer friends and new family members to help support my student would only be a zip code entry away. Second, I would recommend looking into the professionals that reside in my student’s local area that specializes in CP. A quick search through Google reveals that in this hypothetical situation, my student lives in Galveston, Texas and there is a local doctor that specializes in CP. His name is David A. Yngve, MD. Being able to know who the professionals are, medically, will be of major assistance to my student because there are things that are constantly developing in the field of medicine and someone like Doctor Yngve could point my student to a new direction concerning therapy and intervention. Furthermore, mothers and fathers could keep in touch with Doctor Yngve and he could also provide further information for coping and raising a child with CP such as my student. A service I would not recommend is, according to my student’s local area, is the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children in Galveston Texas. Because I have a belief in inclusion of students with disabilities into a regular classroom with students that have no disabilities, I believe that segregating a student with CP with other students that have CP is, though I’m sure he or she would receive more specialized training, of no benefit to not only my student that has a special need, but also to the students without CP. My student would be a beacon of awareness to the other students without a disability. And my view is that because there are so many options and potentials, perhaps one of my students without a disability will one day grow up to become a doctor that would specialize in CP. And perhaps my student that has CP would also one day grow up to be a doctor that specializes in CP. But because I view that inclusion is of the highest priority in students with disabilities, I would recommend against sending my student with CP to the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children.<br />
In my ideal schedule I would have my student with CP to have a separate, more focused learning classroom that gives me one on one time with him or her. Here I am focusing on building skills relating to his or her specific disabilities and am working around or building up on those disabilities. So, from the start of the school day, from 8 until 9:45, I have my own alone time with my student. Furthermore, I am also teaching the same curriculum that my coworker, the main teacher that focuses on the children without the disabilities, has planned with me together from weeks previously. And then from 10:00 to 11:30, my student spends the rest of his or her time with the rest of the class. I have already coordinated with my other coworker, the main teacher that teaches the children without CP and the bulk of the information that needs to be taught on an normal pace is already taught, and from 10:00 to 11:30PM the main teacher focuses on inclusion of my special needs student into the regular classroom schedule. Once lunch begins at 11:30 and ends at 12:30, it is then that we return to the main classroom in an inclusive environment with the other students, until 2:30, which is 30 minutes before school ends. My special needs student and I depart from the classroom earlier in order to avoid the rush of the students leaving because my special needs student with CP could have a physical disability which could slow down the other students or even potentially injure him or herself from the other students rushing out of the classroom. Because the classroom is spaced out in such a manner that my student, who could be in a wheel chair, can easily leave the classroom without much of a distraction, the other students are not very much aware of myself and my special needs student departing.<br />
My special needs student, who could be anywhere from ages 5-12 will be experiencing what is known as the Industry vs. Inferiority stage of Erik Erikson. In this stage teachers become more important as do the peers of the child. (Mcleod, 2013) Children begin to feel a sense of accomplishment in their competencies. (Mcleod, 2013) My special needs student may have major limitations which may inhibit this part of the development. This is why I will focus on developing his or her ability to write, if he or she cannot speak fluently due to a lack of motor control, so that he or she can begin to feel that they can express themselves freely, if not by their mouths but by their minds. Second, I will focus on developing a specific curriculum that emphasizes something physical. So that no matter his or her physical limitations, some sense of autonomy can be achieved through little exercises, dependent upon her or her limitations. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) Third, I would focus on building the students idea of self-image. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) At this age that self-image can be shaky, even in a normally developing child. I would work on finding ways to build an alternative self-image, specifically through the use of a blog and social media, where a student can be a different person in a limitless universe that is the internet. Of course, this would be with the parent’s permission. Finally, I would always speak on eye level with my student if he or she were in a wheel chair to promote a sense of equal footing with myself and my student. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) All activities would be performed on this level.<br />
Finally, it could be that my student is not originally an English speaker. I would provide for a translator for when I need to speak with his or her parents and to also attempt to learn basic commands and praises in that language so that some sense of communication occurs in a meaningful way. It could be that this student not only is involved in my special needs class but also an English as a Second Language course in which he or she is learning English as well as attempting to perform in a regular English speaking classroom, so not only would I attempt to learn basic language skills of that student’s proficiency but to also coordinate with the ESL teacher in order to better improve and progress their skills to perform adequately.</p>
