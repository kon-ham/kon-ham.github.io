<meta name="description" content="The Future Need for Online Learning As the global population around the world continues to swell, the need for nontraditional methods of learning will also grow in demand. Our university currently does not offer online courses. The reported satisfaction of online learning is high and positively correlated with convenience and the perception of value of service. (Sanford, et al. 2017) Students with nontraditional learning backgrounds will need a university that provides for them this service. Our university can satisfy the needs of these students with an online service that provides for such students while at the same time fulfilling faculty and staff satisfaction knowing that a high quality service is being provided to students who appreciate the convenience of learning outside of the classroom. Introduction to Study Proposal of Satisfaction of Students Who Already Take Courses Online Students that take online courses are specific as to the reasons of perceived value of their education. They view convenience as a major factor of satisfaction of their online learning education. (Sanford, et al. 2017) This satisfaction, predictably, falls proportionate to the convenience factor when students report stress from work related demands. There was little to no relationship between learning styles and satisfaction of online learning. Regardless of the broad range of learning styles among students, the factor that led to satisfaction reports was the perception of high value. This is good news for the university. The need for online educational systems is not based upon the course itself but rather of the ability of the university to deliver convenience to the student as well as the ability to derive from the learning platform the university utilizes a perception of high value to the student. (Simmons, 2006) What then to the university that does not yet provide a service to these students? First, a consideration to be made for such a university: What defines a high quality service? Simmons quotes Gonroos (1988) of the concept of quality in the distinction between technical quality and functional quality using the example of an airline transporting the luggage of its passenger. Simmons says the technical quality would be the function of the luggage properly reaching the point of destination. Functional quality in that the contents of the luggage being considered, for example, if there was china or perishable items in the luggage. (Simmons, 2006) How can a university consider this function of quality of service in regards to the delivery methods of an online course? Second, it would appear that the course itself holds no weight to the perception of satisfaction to students. Whether it is calculus or English, students rather seem to focus on the convenience factor, whether it is in a face to face classroom or through an online learning platform. After all, students who attend in traditional means will attempt to schedule the classes around a convenient means to the students own schedule that allows for the student to balance work, life, and schooling as well as the minimizing of course “busywork”. (Sanford, et al. 2017) The question of course “busywork” applies not only to traditional learning but also to the online platform. The question of whether or not to include to the university’s program an online program seems to bring to surface another question – how can universities maintain academic credibility while at the same time reducing the total amount of coursework that may be considered by students to be “busywork”? But, such a question is for another topic of study. Both studies cited here make the case for convenience and quality of service. Our university can take advantage of the opportunity for the growing need for online learning platforms. Soon, students all over the world will be accessing the internet and entering digital classrooms in which learning is done online. The universities that move with this progression of technology and education will be the ones who are left standing. Rationale The rationale for this study is first under the assumption that the university has indeed decided to move forward with the decision to create an online learning division. This research proposal focuses on the university delivering educational content on a platform that competes with other universities that already provide for excellent services for students. A research study should be done on the types of learning platforms that offer convenience to the students. The study should also research the necessary educational goals and components that offer the student a fulfilling and in-depth approach to the course. The study should also include what parts of other competing online curriculum are not necessary to the educational goals of the student and merely overburden the student with the previously mentioned “busywork”. Also, the study ought to clearly define the meaning of convenience and quality of value for the purposes of not only the student, but also for the university. The study provides a clear destination for the university in the designing of an online curriculum. There are many different companies that build educational platforms on which a university can deliver courses. Which platform is best? And, if the research done by the university also agrees with the research of Sanford and Simmons, then should the universities altogether scrap the existing online learning platforms and instead build its own online learning platform? And finally, what of budget concerns? The study of satisfaction of students who take online courses ought to outweigh the costs associated with the building of an online course curriculum. The study should provide clarity of the cost to benefit analysis of creating such a course. Method The sample should include all who are by age, eligible to take online courses. This random but cross-sectional study will survey students who answer in a Likert format the reasons why a student chose his or her classes, the desire to take online courses, and the satisfaction of courses a student has that attends the university. Furthermore, the study should include international students. The size of the sample shall be anywhere from the list of students attending the university as well as the information that can be derived from other learning platforms that mine data from the activities of students that attend online colleges. Sampling procedure follows surveys that are taken from students who already attend online college courses. Surveys can be taken from students who are in a traditional classroom by assigning the survey at the end of the day. Both surveys can be identified by the last four digits of the student’s social security. Demographic information about a student can be taken by offering that information to be completed by the students who take the survey. Those that attend college vary by demographic but one speculates as to whether the demographic of interest of those who wish to attend an online college are older in age, possibly from 35-45. But, the collection of information based upon demographics of those who are in the later stages of life is dependent upon the university in which direction is wishes to go in terms of whether the university will cater to older adults or to a broad spectrum of students of all ages. Sampling was excluded from this study because generalizations were not to be made from the population. This study seeks to base information of whether or not the university shall create an online classroom based upon already existing sources of information as to whether or not the cost outweighs the benefits and if the overall satisfaction of the student who takes online courses will be worth the cost of the creation of said online classroom. Finally, the focus is on the delivery of a online college that delivers that satisfaction to the student – whether it is indeed truly based upon the factors of convenience of if it is based upon the factors of the delivery of quality of service, or both. Design The proposed design for the study would be a qualitative research design with within-subjects as the research design. This type of research design is typical for research groups who want to for example, find the effectiveness of a program. Although the type of question and method of survey was briefly mentioned earlier, this section will elaborate on the topic. The survey will be designed around a Likert-format. Questions will be asked as to whether or not a student agrees or disagrees with the convenience of the class he or she is currently taking. Such questions will include: “The amount of time you spend in class is worth your time”, and “I have trouble managing my life around my class schedule”, or in an online context, “I am not very motivated to finish my online assignments”. However, the majority of information that can be derived from the online portion of a survey can usually be found through a company’s learning platform. Usually these companies include surveys at the end of each class. Patten University, for example, offers such surveys. The university can pay for the informational data and use it in conjunction with the surveys that are taken by students who attend the university in the classroom setting. It should be stated first that there shall be no procedure for retrieving surveys from online students. The university can pay other companies who already have such information. This procedure shall be for the administering of the survey in the classrooms of the universities. The participants in the study will be seated in the classroom as the survey will be administered at the end of the class period. Teachers are suggested to end class 15 minutes earlier to manage the time it takes for participants to take the survey and for them to finish on time to leave class in an appropriate time. The survey can be administered when all of the class is ready, and will be administered to each student. The distribution method will not matter so the survey can be passed to each student in the front of the classroom, who will then pass the remaining tests backwards until each student has a copy of the survey. Before the survey is administered, the teacher who will administer the survey will brief the students. The briefing shall be as follows: “The University is considering the opening of an online classroom portion of the curriculum. Answer to the best of your ability. There is no right or wrong answer. If you have any questions, you may ask them now.” As for controls, each class will administer the survey 15 minutes prior to the end of class. All will be quiet for the duration of the test and each teacher will administer the same brief to each class. The method of delivery will be by paper. Procedure The participants of the study will take the survey by pen or pencil. Students will quietly take the test and then leave the survey on their desks face down as they leave. They will circle whichever item they associate with. The confidentiality of the test shall be protected by the collection of the test and then when research has been completed, will be shredded. During the time of research and collection, the information shall be stored into a locked cabinet. The keys of this document will be held by the researcher in charge. The information will be inputted into a computer. When each sheet of information is inputted, that paper will then be shredded. Those who are inputting the information into the computer are not aware of who the student is. The only identifiable feature of the student is the last four digits of his or her social security number. When the students leave the teacher shall collect all the surveys and place them in the manila envelope provided with the packet of surveys. Then the teachers shall seal the envelope and then wait for retrieval by the research team. From there the surveys go straight to the processing of the information onto the computer or into the locked cabinet. Analysis Due to the use of both an in-house survey as well as the purchasing and use of surveys mined from other companies, the analysis process of this study would be a meta-analysis. Determining the type of response is dependent upon the data purchased from the learning platform development companies. The study should reveal what it is that the students are looking for in an online curriculum. If convenience is the desire for most students, what do those specific platforms utilize that enables the convenience for students? The survey taken inside the classrooms of the university should have a significance level of at least a 3.5 on the average Likert score. The survey merely expresses the desire of the students who currently take classes in the traditional form if they wish to take classes online. This is a scale to justify the cost of the program development. Conclusion The university should consider first the students it currently serves. Should it consider an alternative to the traditional form of teaching? If so, is there a desire from the current students to take online courses? What specifically are the aspects of the other competing schools in the area of convenience for students? And, does the online platform the university offer the quality of service that students are looking for? The future of the university may rest upon the forming of the curriculum of an online classroom setting. With the advent of many other colleges forming similar programs, it would be shortsighted to ignore the potentials to serve its current students as well as all future students for the curriculum of the future." />

The information will be inputted into a computer. When each sheet of information is inputted, that paper will then be shredded. Those who are inputting the information into the computer are not aware of who the student is. The only identifiable feature of the student is the last four digits of his or her social security number. When the students leave the teacher shall collect all the surveys and place them in the manila envelope provided with the packet of surveys. Then the teachers shall seal the envelope and then wait for retrieval by the research team. From there the surveys go straight to the processing of the information onto the computer or into the locked cabinet. Analysis Due to the use of both an in-house survey as well as the purchasing and use of surveys mined from other companies, the analysis process of this study would be a meta-analysis. Determining the type of response is dependent upon the data purchased from the learning platform development companies. The study should reveal what it is that the students are looking for in an online curriculum. If convenience is the desire for most students, what do those specific platforms utilize that enables the convenience for students? The survey taken inside the classrooms of the university should have a significance level of at least a 3.5 on the average Likert score. The survey merely expresses the desire of the students who currently take classes in the traditional form if they wish to take classes online. This is a scale to justify the cost of the program development. Conclusion The university should consider first the students it currently serves. Should it consider an alternative to the traditional form of teaching? If so, is there a desire from the current students to take online courses? What specifically are the aspects of the other competing schools in the area of convenience for students? And, does the online platform the university offer the quality of service that students are looking for? The future of the university may rest upon the forming of the curriculum of an online classroom setting. With the advent of many other colleges forming similar programs, it would be shortsighted to ignore the potentials to serve its current students as well as all future students for the curriculum of the future.","headline":"PSY311 Experimental Psychology Final Project (The validity of online learning amidst coronavirus shutdown, or how we yold you so)","dateModified":"2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00","datePublished":"2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy311-experimental-psychology-final-project/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mark Otto"},"url":"http://localhost:4000/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy311-experimental-psychology-final-project/","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

  <p>The Future Need for Online Learning<br />
As the global population around the world continues to swell, the need for nontraditional methods of learning will also grow in demand. Our university currently does not offer online courses. The reported satisfaction of online learning is high and positively correlated with convenience and the perception of value of service. (Sanford, et al. 2017) Students with nontraditional learning backgrounds will need a university that provides for them this service. Our university can satisfy the needs of these students with an online service that provides for such students while at the same time fulfilling faculty and staff satisfaction knowing that a high quality service is being provided to students who appreciate the convenience of learning outside of the classroom.<br />
Introduction to Study Proposal of Satisfaction of Students Who Already Take Courses Online<br />
Students that take online courses are specific as to the reasons of perceived value of their education. They view convenience as a major factor of satisfaction of their online learning education. (Sanford, et al. 2017) This satisfaction, predictably, falls proportionate to the convenience factor when students report stress from work related demands. There was little to no relationship between learning styles and satisfaction of online learning. Regardless of the broad range of learning styles among students, the factor that led to satisfaction reports was the perception of high value. This is good news for the university. The need for online educational systems is not based upon the course itself but rather of the ability of the university to deliver convenience to the student as well as the ability to derive from the learning platform the university utilizes a perception of high value to the student. (Simmons, 2006)<br />
What then to the university that does not yet provide a service to these students? First, a consideration to be made for such a university: What defines a high quality service? Simmons quotes Gonroos (1988) of the concept of quality in the distinction between technical quality and functional quality using the example of an airline transporting the luggage of its passenger. Simmons says the technical quality would be the function of the luggage properly reaching the point of destination. Functional quality in that the contents of the luggage being considered, for example, if there was china or perishable items in the luggage. (Simmons, 2006) How can a university consider this function of quality of service in regards to the delivery methods of an online course?<br />
Second, it would appear that the course itself holds no weight to the perception of satisfaction to students. Whether it is calculus or English, students rather seem to focus on the convenience factor, whether it is in a face to face classroom or through an online learning platform. After all, students who attend in traditional means will attempt to schedule the classes around a convenient means to the students own schedule that allows for the student to balance work, life, and schooling as well as the minimizing of course “busywork”. (Sanford, et al. 2017) The question of course “busywork” applies not only to traditional learning but also to the online platform. The question of whether or not to include to the university’s program an online program seems to bring to surface another question – how can universities maintain academic credibility while at the same time reducing the total amount of coursework that may be considered by students to be “busywork”? But, such a question is for another topic of study.<br />
Both studies cited here make the case for convenience and quality of service. Our university can take advantage of the opportunity for the growing need for online learning platforms. Soon, students all over the world will be accessing the internet and entering digital classrooms in which learning is done online. The universities that move with this progression of technology and education will be the ones who are left standing.<br />
Rationale<br />
The rationale for this study is first under the assumption that the university has indeed decided to move forward with the decision to create an online learning division. This research proposal focuses on the university delivering educational content on a platform that competes with other universities that already provide for excellent services for students. A research study should be done on the types of learning platforms that offer convenience to the students. The study should also research the necessary educational goals and components that offer the student a fulfilling and in-depth approach to the course. The study should also include what parts of other competing online curriculum are not necessary to the educational goals of the student and merely overburden the student with the previously mentioned “busywork”. Also, the study ought to clearly define the meaning of convenience and quality of value for the purposes of not only the student, but also for the university.<br />
The study provides a clear destination for the university in the designing of an online curriculum. There are many different companies that build educational platforms on which a university can deliver courses. Which platform is best? And, if the research done by the university also agrees with the research of Sanford and Simmons, then should the universities altogether scrap the existing online learning platforms and instead build its own online learning platform? And finally, what of budget concerns? The study of satisfaction of students who take online courses ought to outweigh the costs associated with the building of an online course curriculum. The study should provide clarity of the cost to benefit analysis of creating such a course.<br />
Method<br />
The sample should include all who are by age, eligible to take online courses. This random but cross-sectional study will survey students who answer in a Likert format the reasons why a student chose his or her classes, the desire to take online courses, and the satisfaction of courses a student has that attends the university. Furthermore, the study should include international students. The size of the sample shall be anywhere from the list of students attending the university as well as the information that can be derived from other learning platforms that mine data from the activities of students that attend online colleges.<br />
Sampling procedure follows surveys that are taken from students who already attend online college courses. Surveys can be taken from students who are in a traditional classroom by assigning the survey at the end of the day. Both surveys can be identified by the last four digits of the student’s social security.<br />
Demographic information about a student can be taken by offering that information to be completed by the students who take the survey. Those that attend college vary by demographic but one speculates as to whether the demographic of interest of those who wish to attend an online college are older in age, possibly from 35-45. But, the collection of information based upon demographics of those who are in the later stages of life is dependent upon the university in which direction is wishes to go in terms of whether the university will cater to older adults or to a broad spectrum of students of all ages.<br />
Sampling was excluded from this study because generalizations were not to be made from the population. This study seeks to base information of whether or not the university shall create an online classroom based upon already existing sources of information as to whether or not the cost outweighs the benefits and if the overall satisfaction of the student who takes online courses will be worth the cost of the creation of said online classroom. Finally, the focus is on the delivery of a online college that delivers that satisfaction to the student – whether it is indeed truly based upon the factors of convenience of if it is based upon the factors of the delivery of quality of service, or both.<br />
Design<br />
The proposed design for the study would be a qualitative research design with within-subjects as the research design. This type of research design is typical for research groups who want to for example, find the effectiveness of a program.<br />
Although the type of question and method of survey was briefly mentioned earlier, this section will elaborate on the topic. The survey will be designed around a Likert-format. Questions will be asked as to whether or not a student agrees or disagrees with the convenience of the class he or she is currently taking. Such questions will include: “The amount of time you spend in class is worth your time”, and “I have trouble managing my life around my class schedule”, or in an online context, “I am not very motivated to finish my online assignments”. However, the majority of information that can be derived from the online portion of a survey can usually be found through a company’s learning platform. Usually these companies include surveys at the end of each class. Patten University, for example, offers such surveys. The university can pay for the informational data and use it in conjunction with the surveys that are taken by students who attend the university in the classroom setting.<br />
It should be stated first that there shall be no procedure for retrieving surveys from online students. The university can pay other companies who already have such information. This procedure shall be for the administering of the survey in the classrooms of the universities.<br />
The participants in the study will be seated in the classroom as the survey will be administered at the end of the class period. Teachers are suggested to end class 15 minutes earlier to manage the time it takes for participants to take the survey and for them to finish on time to leave class in an appropriate time. The survey can be administered when all of the class is ready, and will be administered to each student. The distribution method will not matter so the survey can be passed to each student in the front of the classroom, who will then pass the remaining tests backwards until each student has a copy of the survey. Before the survey is administered, the teacher who will administer the survey will brief the students. The briefing shall be as follows: “The University is considering the opening of an online classroom portion of the curriculum. Answer to the best of your ability. There is no right or wrong answer. If you have any questions, you may ask them now.”<br />
As for controls, each class will administer the survey 15 minutes prior to the end of class. All will be quiet for the duration of the test and each teacher will administer the same brief to each class.<br />
The method of delivery will be by paper.<br />
Procedure<br />
The participants of the study will take the survey by pen or pencil. Students will quietly take the test and then leave the survey on their desks face down as they leave. They will circle whichever item they associate with. The confidentiality of the test shall be protected by the collection of the test and then when research has been completed, will be shredded. During the time of research and collection, the information shall be stored into a locked cabinet. The keys of this document will be held by the researcher in charge. The information will be inputted into a computer. When each sheet of information is inputted, that paper will then be shredded. Those who are inputting the information into the computer are not aware of who the student is. The only identifiable feature of the student is the last four digits of his or her social security number.<br />
When the students leave the teacher shall collect all the surveys and place them in the manila envelope provided with the packet of surveys. Then the teachers shall seal the envelope and then wait for retrieval by the research team. From there the surveys go straight to the processing of the information onto the computer or into the locked cabinet.<br />
Analysis<br />
Due to the use of both an in-house survey as well as the purchasing and use of surveys mined from other companies, the analysis process of this study would be a meta-analysis. Determining the type of response is dependent upon the data purchased from the learning platform development companies. The study should reveal what it is that the students are looking for in an online curriculum. If convenience is the desire for most students, what do those specific platforms utilize that enables the convenience for students?<br />
The survey taken inside the classrooms of the university should have a significance level of at least a 3.5 on the average Likert score. The survey merely expresses the desire of the students who currently take classes in the traditional form if they wish to take classes online. This is a scale to justify the cost of the program development.<br />
Conclusion<br />
The university should consider first the students it currently serves. Should it consider an alternative to the traditional form of teaching? If so, is there a desire from the current students to take online courses? What specifically are the aspects of the other competing schools in the area of convenience for students? And, does the online platform the university offer the quality of service that students are looking for?<br />
The future of the university may rest upon the forming of the curriculum of an online classroom setting. With the advent of many other colleges forming similar programs, it would be shortsighted to ignore the potentials to serve its current students as well as all future students for the curriculum of the future.</p>
