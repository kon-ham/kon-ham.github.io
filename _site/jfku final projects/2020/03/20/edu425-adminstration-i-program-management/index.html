<p>Curriculum Development<br />
Big Day for PreK is “a proven-effective comprehensive program that ensures kindergarten readiness by building the foundation for success in school and life.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Specifically, the Big Day for PreK curriculum is split into six compartments: developmentally appropriate practices, daily responsive instruction, evaluation programs, extended play, daily math and writing, and teacher and child interactions. This curriculum is encapsulated in five “elements of success”. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Those elements are big experiences, meaningful conversations, a wide variety of the best children’s literature and nonfiction, innovative technology, and comprehensive curriculum. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) There is considerable research to the contribution that Big Day curriculum has on the improve rate of literacy and mathematical improvement on students. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) The benefit to this curriculum is that Big Day focuses on social-emotional development. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) According to Big Day, “Every theme in Big Day for PreK has a social-emotional focus that emphasizes what is essential for helping children be future-ready.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Big Day also focuses on a liberal arts approach to learning, which integrates all subjects of learning into one experience. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Since Imagination Day Care emphasizes a collaborative approach, Big Day curriculum fills the need for a curriculum that partners with families and educators to provide an educational service that encourages communication back and forth all parties. Since Imagination Day Care also emphasizes children being able to read before kindergarten, Big Day curriculum also fills the need to have children learning and developing language skills through providing opportunities for “modeling and reinforcing conversation, vocabulary, and sentence structures across social and academic settings.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Finally, Big Day provides evaluation that provides ample opportunities for Imagination Day Care center’s educators to fill in gaps of learning when needed, and to if necessary, provide alternative intervention. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018)<br />
Job Description for Teacher<br />
Relevant Duties<br />
Duties for Imagination Day Care Center educators shall be as follows: Educators are expected to be held responsible to the parents and to God in the proper upbringing up the child. Educators will diligently apply the Big Day curriculum towards the students without fail. Potential educators shall be advised that the work of education does not fall merely between 6:30 to 6:00PM, but rather that the work of the educator is that he or she is working 24/7 for the raising of these children into responsible adults. In essence, potential educators are to be reminded that the work of an educator is a lifestyle and not merely a profession. Therefore, potential applicants may be expected to show in attendance events that may arise outside of the normal day care operations, in particular for social events or for purposes of raising awareness of the day care’s mission statement and vision. Because this day care operates on a belief that the educators are all workers involved in the work of the Kingdom of Heaven, they may be asked to involve themselves in the cleaning of facilities in order that they may take pride in their work as educators and the facility that is producing future high-quality adults. Teachers may also be asked to fill in for other teachers that call in sick or to provide for transportation for families that may encounter emergency situations where a child cannot return home.<br />
Certification Requirements/ Required/Preferred Background<br />
Imagination Day Care does not require potential applicants to have a college degree. Minimum standards are as follows: Applicant must be 18 with a high school diploma or equivalency. Part time applicants must be at least 16 and without a high school diploma, but will require parental approval. Experience is not necessary as on the job training will be provided for. Potential applicant must provide proof of membership in church of their choosing.<br />
Plan for Event<br />
Why the Event is Taking Place<br />
This event is taking place to promote the use of the day care facility as an incubator for community events in which families can meet other families and the educators in order to more fully engage with those around them, to take advantage of the networking hub available to them and the available social capital, and to encourage families to see Imagination Day Care Center as the engine or facilitator of integration of families, communities and educators. Therefore, Imagination Day Care Center will provide a barbeque and an outside movie to families, educators, and children.<br />
Who is Expected to Participate<br />
All educators are expected to participate in order that the families may meet and engage with the educators that there might be a fluid dynamic of exchange of communication that facilitates a learning environment for the child that equips the child for the future. Families of these children are expected but not demanded.<br />
When the Event Will Take Place<br />
The event will take place on the third Friday of the month. It will take place at approximately 5:30PM and end at 9:00PM.<br />
Where the Event Will Take Place<br />
The event will take place at the day care facility. Food will be had outside and the movie will also be had outside in the playground.<br />
How Long the Event Will Take Place For<br />
Since the event begins at 5:30PM and ends at 9:00PM, that would be approximately 3.5 hours in which the event will last for.<br />
How the Parents Will Receive Notice of the Event<br />
Imagination Day Care has captured the addresses of the parents at the beginning of enrollment. Therefore Imagination Day Care will send notices to parents through mail as well as sending home a pamphlet making aware the parents of the event.<br />
How Will Staff be Involved in the Event<br />
A volunteer will be made for the preparation of the barbeque. Food will be provided for by the day care. The rest of the staff are encouraged to either help prepare the food or to mingle with the family members and children. The day care director or supervisor will be available to float to necessary tasks if needed. The objective of the event is to provide an opportunity for families to relax and to share information with other families, if needed.</p>
