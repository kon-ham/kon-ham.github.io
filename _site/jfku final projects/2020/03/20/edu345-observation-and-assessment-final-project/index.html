observed and assessed by the Child Care Organization in order to present to me a yearly progress report that involves information relating to the scholastic achievement of my child. I am aware that I can opt out of this at any time, as long as written request is given to the Child Care Organization. I am aware that this observation and assessment is a year-long evolution and that I will be presented with a portfolio at the end of this years’ time.</p>

<p>Preface<br />
Before I continue with the assessment information that has been compiled for you, I want to be able to explain the four types of assessments that were accessed in order to create this portfolio for you. The four assessments we’ve used for the creation of Josue’s portfolio were a running record, anecdotal record, observation scale, and a checklist. The first two are mainly for use by the teachers here at Child Care Organization but they are also helpful to you too, as a parent that you can visualize what life has been like for Josue and in particular, through the eyes of the teacher. The second two assessments are also utilized by teachers but you may find them to be more beneficial to you as the latter two assessments involve checklists and rating scales so that you can gauge for yourself where your child falls in relation to the expectations of the curriculum we have here. If we have done our job correctly, you should see an improvement in Josue’s development from when he first enrolled here to one year into the future.<br />
The first assessment will be a running record. Originally, we were not entirely sure of Josue’s language development. We are aware of his lack of exposure to the English language at home and his cultural upbringing – we are also aware that Josue struck us as a bright young man. However, we wanted to be sure that his language development was not being delayed as a result of other issues unrelated to English being his secondary language. We were also not sure if he was unable to understand our instructions because of a potential hearing disorder. Given the fact that Josue is learning English at a consistent pace from the interaction of his peers, it was not likely that Josue had an impairment of hearing – but we wanted to be sure of his condition and where we stood in his language development. Finally, we typically start our assessments with a running record because it gives us an opportunity to step back from participating in the classroom and to allow us to record as much live data as possible from Josue’s interactions with the environment and his peers. Specifically, running records record almost everything that Josue’s will do in the given amount of time that we utilize in his assessment. This method is naturalistic so we can sit and observe Josue “as he is”. This gives us an opportunity to step away from our own biases as educators. By making a running record assessment, we capture everything Josue does so that we can later make an analysis of his behavior and development.<br />
The second assessment we utilized for Josue is an anecdotal record. The benefit to an anecdotal record is that unlike a running record, we can begin to record events that are significant to our goals and objectives relating to Child Care Organization’s curriculum. That is, our teachers now begin to choose what behaviors to record from Josue. This allows us to highlight for you, as the parent, and for ourselves, as educators, events that are significant to Josue. Specifically, we were looking for emerging behaviors that indicated that Josue was displaying progression in his language learning of English. Furthermore, we can mark baseline observations, or standards in which Josue’s language development revolved around, so that when comparing baseline observations and emerging skills, we can gauge that progression in a more scientific method. To further elaborate our process of running records and anecdotal records, we used running records to first establish baseline observations in case any of our biases would potentially hinder Josue’s academic potential. Once a running record baseline observation was established, we began to taper off running records into anecdotal records. This movement from running records to anecdotal records has two functions. The first function is to give Josue as much attention as needed in both observation environments. A running record involves that a participant be detached from Josue and to observe him from a naturalistic view. This means that there can only be one observer per child. This moves us into the second function of tapering our records from running records to anecdotal records. As with all children, educators must be involved in the lives of the children and to make an impact upon them. Running records do not allow for this in the sense that the educator is no longer participating in the classroom. Anecdotal records allow for the teacher to return to Josue and to be involved in Josue’s curriculum in a very personal way, all the while capturing key, vital moments of Josue’s progression.<br />
Third, we’ve developed an observation scale, or rating scale so that we can quantify the data that Josue accumulates as he navigates through our curriculum. What we mean by quantify is to take the running and anecdote records and to drive them into a clear and concise direction of where Josue needs to be. The observational scale provides teachers with expectations of achievement for Josue and also provides a numerical value for Josue’s progress. This numerical value can help us and you as a parent gauge in another way, besides the anecdotal and running records the progress Josue has made. Furthermore, as a parent you can see clearly the expectations and goals of the curriculum set forth in the observation scale.<br />
Finally, the observational scale and the checklist are a major advantage to you as a parent because you can see in front of you quantifiable and clear data that ideally, you’ll work with us in order to meet those objectives. The checklist serves also as an important piece of assessment that we utilize as a final assessment of Josue’s year at the Child Care Organization. This checklist is used nearing the final semester of Josue’s term and is used to create a new curriculum for Josue for the next year – a curriculum that is exciting, challenging, and also rewarding. This checklist is used as a final assessment because there are significant challenges to only using a checklist as a sole use of assessment. That is, there is not enough data for us to make an assessment of Josue to professionally and ethically continue with his curriculum on the basis of one checklist. Therefore, we have used this checklist as a form of graduation requirements at the last part of Josue’s term. We assume that enough data has been compiled on his behalf through the anecdotal, running, and observational scale records. This checklist benefits you because you can very quickly see a summary of the information and achievement that Josue has been involved in the past year. This checklist should give you a sense of encouragement that your child is headed in the right direction and that the curriculum has done its work.</p>

<p>Observation via Running Record Part 2<br />
Josue is exchanging conversation with his peers. It is free time. Josue is walking up to Lisa and says, “Lisa, what are you doing?” as he watches over her shoulder. Lisa replies saying “I’m coloring an elephant. You can color this elephant with me, if you want.” Josue makes eye contact when she says this and he puts his hands in his pockets. Josue takes his hands and points to Lisa and says “color”. Lisa shakes her head up and down and repeats, “color”. Another teacher, Ms. Fritzel passes by and says to Josue “Josue can you please take a seat so that I can give you your coloring supplies?” Josue stands around, keeping eye contact with Mrs. Fritzel as she takes him by hand and leads him to his chair. Josue sits and says to Mrs. Fritzel, “Sit, thank you”. Mrs. Fritzel passes to Josue the coloring supplies as Josue says to Mrs. Fritzel, “Mrs. Fritzel, thank you.” Mrs. Fritzel responds “You’re very welcome.” Josue is handed a tray of coloring supplies and watches Lisa color. He begins to color in the drawing that is on his desk. Mrs. Fritzel says to Josue, “You can color the elephant any color you’d like. Just be sure to stay within the lines.” Josue looks at Mrs. Fritzel, nods, and says “Thank you.” He then looks to Lisa’s drawing and begins to draw. He picks up the crayon, looks at Lisa’s drawing, and then back to his. He begins to color in the elephant. He looks around at other student’s drawings before resuming coloring of his drawing. He colors within the lines. He is coloring but looks to Lisa’s drawing every so often. Mrs. Fritzel calls to Josue, “Josue, can you please pass this scissor to Lisa?” Josue looks at Mrs. Fritzel and stares at her for a moment. Josue stands up, walks to Mrs. Fritzel and stands there. Mrs. Fritzel says, “Yes Josue. Very good. Now take this scissor to Lisa. Take this scissor to Lisa.” Mrs. Fritzel then points to Lisa, and then nods to Josue. Josue takes the scissors and gives it to Lisa. Josue then stands there before Mrs. Fritzel notices. “Yes Josue, sit.” Josue then says “sit” before sitting. He then says “Thank you Mrs. Fritzel.”<br />

<p>Observation via Anecdotal Record Part 2<br />
Context: Josue has been enrolled in the Child Care Organization for nearly 6 months since his initial series of assessments in February. He is now involved in a science experiment involving the use of diet Coca Cola and Mentos.<br />
Josue is sitting down with the rest of his classroom. He says to John, “John, sit here with me” as he pats the carpeted floor of the classroom. John sits next to him. Mrs. Fritzel sits in front of the children. She says to them all, “Class, do you remember the word we used for why we got such a messy explosion from the diet Cola and the Mentos candy?” Josue raises his hand. Mrs. Fritzel says to Josue, “Yes Josue, do you know what the word was? Please, stand up to speak.” Josue stands up, and says, “Mrs. Fritzel. The word we used last week was reaction.” Mrs. Fritzel responds, “Very good Josue. Please have a sit.” Josue sits down.<br />
Summary: Josue is beginning to show that he can excel with Mrs. Fritzel’s instructions. He no longer hesitates when Mrs. Fritzel asks him to sit, stand, or other basic commands. This science experiment involving the diet Cola and Mentos seems to have gone well. Josue is learning words other than the words of his peers. He is learning scientific processes as he is expanding his vocabulary.</p>

Setting Josue’s English comprehension as well as verbal ability to speak is tested through a means of a checklist. This process is a one-day process in which Josue is reviewed for his general ability to master the English language in order to advance to the next level of Child Care Organization’s curriculum.</p>

<p>Observation via Checklist Part 2<br />
Ability to conversate with peers in a casual conversation like dialogue x<br />
Writing and spelling ability does not hinder learning process x<br />
Ability to persuade students or peers that his or her way is the better way without the use of force and minimal body language x<br />
Ability to barter, ask, and share school supplies and treats x<br />
Ability to translate what grandmother and mother says effectively to teachers during parent teacher conferences x<br />
Can introduce new students into the classroom and guide new students into the curriculum x<br />
Ability to respond to the teacher with positive or negative responses and to ask for clarity if needed x<br />
Ability to explain scientific processes or fictional accounts of books read in a manner that is understandable to listeners x</p>

<p>Conclusion, Analysis, and Moving Forward<br />
Josue demonstrates great skill in being able to adapt to his environment. As you can see from his assessment portfolio, he probably does not have any learning disabilities. This may seem obvious in hindsight, but there is need to be sure in case a misdiagnosis results in precious time being wasted on both our end on and Josue’s end. Time is valuable, and is the only thing that we will never get back. Therefore, we have created this assessment so that you as Josue’s parents understand the amount of time well spent Josue has invested into this curriculum. Josue has, if you see his portfolio, advanced greatly under our curriculum. There is no doubt – Josue has the ability to adapt to his circumstances and to show great potential for the future. His language learning ability has greatly improved and now Josue appears to show very little difficulty in overcoming the environment he has been placed, in our curriculum.<br />
Now, we must consider where Josue must go next. Josue is displaying ability to learn at the next level of Child Care Organization. This is obvious. However, we would like to be able to recommend any sort of further possibilities so that Josue can maximize his time spent here and to accelerate him, and if possible, to make him superior over his peers. The first is that he be given an opportunity to attend a summer camp where it is English speakers only. There is no specific one he needs to attend, only one that he expresses interest in. The reason for this is that Josue appears to express an ability to learn as he goes. This ability is something that we ought to encourage and foster. Second, I recommend that Josue and his father be given the opportunity for Josue to be placed in a regular class. Josue’s English ability, though obvious that he is not a native speaker, appears to be such that, according to our assessment, he is completely capable of handling an English speaker’s academic course. We have been able to verify he has no language or learning disabilities, so therefore it is upon the rest of his teachers to give him the opportunity to learn at the same pace of his regular English speakers.</p>
