<meta name="description" content="Bronfenfenner’s theory is based upon an idea of ecological theory. Ecological theory is the idea that “human development is inseparable from the environmental contexts in which a person develops.” In essence, this idea is that human beings develop in a complex set of networks. These networks are comprised of varying levels of intimacy – from as intimate as a child’s parents or siblings to as distant as an ethnic group of peoples that share values and outlooks. These networks are all correlated and in the ecological theory the idea is that there is a hierarchy of influence between the lower or upper, or intimate to un-intimate relationships. These hierarchies or varying levels of intimacy, or as ecological theorists call levels of influence, are all interconnected in complex ways. In order to understand this concept, I have considered an example for the reader. Consider a rainbow. How many colors are in a rainbow? Seven? I propose to the reader to consider at what point does red become orange? At what point does the gradient between yellow become green? I believe this demonstrates in a crude sort of way the complexities between the levels of influence in ecological theory. The established levels of ecological theory according to Bronfenfenner or any other ecological theorist is established for the sake of categorizing established levels so that there can be a form of a basis of measurement for the reader and myself to understand. This basis should help us to understand the complexities involved in the variety of influences in the development of the lives of human beings. Bronfenfenner has established four levels of influence according to his perspective of ecological theory. They are as follows: microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems. The microsystem “consists of people and objects in an individual’s immediate environment.” This level strongly influrnces development. Consider the parents or siblings. (Kail, 2014) The mesosystem “provides connections across microsystems because what happens in a microsystem is likely to influence others.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of the interconnections between work life responsibilities and home life responsibilities. (Kail, 2014) It is easy to imagine that sometimes a stressful day at work can carry over into your home life when you come home and you still feel the pressures of managing your work life while you are at home. The Exosystem “refers to the social settings that a person may not experience firsthand but that still influence development.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of government policies influencing an individual’s life, and he uses the example of a participant using welfare. (Kail, 2014) Also consider too if there were to be a war that breaks out somewhere in another country and because the government feels the need is great for more people to serve in this war, it could mandate a draft which would, if the individual were a male, change that person’s life very quickly, though he has no real personal interactions with this government like he would have potentially had with his parents or siblings. Finally, the macrosystem. “The broadest environmental context is the macrosystem, the cultures and subcultures in which the microsystem, mesosystem, and exosystem are embedded.” (Kail, 2014) Consider the outlook on life that an ethnic group collectively share. Expressions of bereavement are different amongst the different cultures as well as ideas and roles of filial relations or of gender roles. According to ecological theory, these relationships are all interconnected in almost infinite amount of combinations depending upon the individual. It is probably not possible to list all of them and how they all influence a person’s individual development, however it is possible to gain a general idea of a person’s development through the use of categorization in which different levels of development can be “split” or attributed into sections. In Bronfenfenner’s case, it is four levels, splits, or categories of attributes. Perhaps now it is easier for the reader to see the levels of from friends, family, and siblings to as far reaching as culture and religious outlooks from a civilizational perspective. From the microsystem perspective, I was raised to be working nearly always. My father wakes up at 3:00 in the morning and comes home at 7:30 in the evening. This routine has continued for nearly 30 years. He does not intend to stop. He has placed upon me a desire to want to work, and that work is good. I also have a younger sister that is 8 years younger than me. I was like a second father to her, so I was also raised inadvertently as a man that has had experience with development of a younger person since I was constantly asked to take care of my sister through babysitting or picking her up from her school. My sister and I don’t have a friendly relationship because we are not necessarily friends, but the love is great between her and I in a deep way because of the time I spent taking care of her. Sometimes after a long day of work I come home and I still feel stressed so I will have an alcoholic drink. Although I should be learning to better manage work-life stress sometimes I come home and cope with it in a way that I feel is not beneficial to me. But every day these actions lead to a conclusion in my life. So on the days that I learn to better manage my work-life stress I find that I learn that I can be more resilient with life in general. This is good for me, and I feel that this has a strong level of development in who I am as a person, shaping my personality as well as my character. This is my mesosystem of influence. When I obtained my citizenship, I joined the military. I had a sense of patriotic pride for my new country so I felt the need to “serve my country”. If I had obtained my citizenship in a different country where serving in the military is not considered a patriotic thing to do, I am doubtful I would have joined the military as I did when I obtained my citizenship. Also, when Congress approves a budget increase for the military and therefore I receive a pay raise of around 5%, I also benefit from this situation. Increased money allows me just a little bit more freedom in my life. Direct policy changes in the government have major effects upon my life. This is the exosystem of influence in my life. Finally the macrosystem. I am ethnically a Korean. So that means I have a specific outlook on life and family that is unique to my culture and ethnic group. For example, I am expected to live with my parents in the same house even while I am married. This is a big difference for Americans. Also, I have noticed that Koreans mourn for the loss of their loved ones in a specific way. There is a lot of weeping, sobbing, and perhaps in the view of an American, a form of hysteria. This is considered acceptable in Korean culture, and in fact it may be considered strange if one were act in a manner of stoicism like in Western funerals. Erikson’s theory of development is based off of the psychodynamic theory. This theory has its basis of knowledge from Sigmund Freud. (Kail, 2014) Kail says, “…psychodynamic theories hold that development is largely determined by how well people resolve conflicts they face at different ages.” Sigmund Freud’s theory of personality development was based on the idea that “personality emerges from conflicts that children experience between what they want to do and what society wants them to do.” (Kail, 2014) Erikson elaborated on this in that “Erikson proposed that personality development is determined by the interaction of an internal maturational plan and external societal demands.” (Kail, 2014) In Erikson’s theory, there are eight stages in his particular theory of life cycle. (Kail, 2014) These stages are trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and ego integrity vs. despair. Trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, and initiative vs. guilt are the first three levels of development that occur in a young developing child. In the trust vs. mistrust stage, an infant learns to trust his or herself and learns to trust others. Erikson also theorizes that an infant also learns the concept of hope through the experience of mistrust and trust, “an openness to new experience tempered by wariness that discomfort or danger may arise.” (Kail, 2014) In autonomy vs. doubt, children understand they can control their actions. (Kail, 2014) Here the autonomy is also countered by the child’s self-doubt in whether he or she can or cannot handle a situation by his or herself. Erikson says that the child learns the concept of will during this stage, which is “a young child’s understanding that he or she can act on the world intentionally, which occurs when autonomy, shame, and doubt are in balance.” (Kail, 2014) In initiative vs. guilt, children learn to explore their environment. (Kail, 2014) This includes asking questions and imagining possibilities. (Kail, 2014) They also hold guilt since their initiative could conflict with the initiatives of others. (Kail, 2014) Here, a child learns purpose, which is “achieved with a balance between individual initiative and willingness to cooperate with others.” (Kail, 2014) Industry vs. Inferiority is when the child learns specific skills like writing or mathematics. The child learns that he or she can learn skills and to be good at them, while at the same time if the child fails in this development he or she feels a sense of inferiority in being unable to accomplish tasks. This is the stage where a child learns the virtue of competence. Identity vs. role confusion is a stage where adolescents to teenagers begin to learn their identities versus identities pushed on them by parents, peers, or society. (Mcleod, 2013) Children are learning to fit in society. In this stage, the child learns the concept of fidelity, which is to “commit one’s self to others on the basis of accepting others, even when there may be ideological differences.” (Mcleod, 2013) During this period of learning who they are, they may develop role confusion as a result of a failure to find an identity. (Mcleod, 2013) Intimacy vs. isolation occurs from 18 to 40, where the individual learns to develop intimate relationships or isolation. This stage of Erikson’s theory develops the virtue of love. (Mcleod, 2013) In generativity vs. stagnation, careers, families, and relationships become solidified. (Mcleod, 2013) If an individual fails in this stage, he or she becomes unproductive, or stagnant. (Mcleod, 2013) This develops the virtue of care. (Mcleod, 2013) The final stage is the ego integrity vs. despair stage. From 65+ onwards, the individual makes an assessment of his or her life and finds that life was fully accomplished in the way the individual desired or finds that life was lived short of the goals the individual had envisioned, leading to despair. (Mcleod, 2013) This stage produces the virtue of wisdom, which “enables a person to look back on their life with a sense of closure and completeness, and also accept death without fear.” (Mcleod, 2013) The first three stages of my life involved infancy to becoming a self-aware child. My mother breastfed me and kept me close to her side as often as possible. During these three stages I can recall a story my mother told me. She said when I was sitting in the shopping cart, I would take groceries to hand to the clerk and ask “how much” for as many items as I could. I also remember my parents allowing me to play as I wished, and having put a battery in my mouth and feeling the electrical charge from the battery, I felt embarrassed to have done what I must have thought was a silly thing. In the industry vs. inferiority stage, I remember having to be left home alone whenever it was possible. The first day I was left home alone as a result of my parents having to work nearly 80 something hours each week, I remember feeling a sense of despair as I looked out the window, waiting for my mother to return, even though it had only been a few minutes since she had left. But I do also remember getting to a certain point in this stage of my life where I was able to take care of myself as I was left home alone, to the point where I made my own meals through the microwave, played computer games, and eventually fell asleep to awake to my parents coming back home. Although I had not known it, I had a feeling of a sense of mastery in being left home alone because I remember a sense of casualness I had from being alone, even to the point of where I began to prefer that environment. In the identity vs. role confusion, I remember that my family had to move around frequently during this stage of my life because of my parents starting and failing many small businesses. I moved around a lot and found I had very few friends. I remember also asking my friends during the fourth grade if they thought I was more of a skater or more of a punk, trying to fit into certain clichés I felt I had or wanted to fit into. This stage involved me buying skating shoes and trying to buy certain kinds of t-shirts I felt were appropriate to who I was. I recall a large sense of pressure to try to fit in and to find a group of people that I felt I could associate with. In the end, I found that I was more of an individual rather than a person who identified with a group. I find that now I don’t identify so much with groups as much as I do with people who share the same ideas and outlooks on life. Furthermore, I feel I’ve developed a sense of fidelity because though I have a strong sense of what I think is right and wrong, I have begun to learn to accept others and their ideas, even if I feel they are incorrect. Intimacy vs. isolation is where I am currently in my life. I have not had a meaningful relationship with a significant other in many years, and due to my frequent moving, I have not maintained many friendships. I am also quick to reject friends if I feel they are burdening me or if I feel they are incorrect in their perspectives in life. Part of this reason for rejection is because I feel that I want to surround myself with people that I feel are similar to me and my outlooks. However, I have maintained three or four friends now that I feel are similar to my outlook on life and I am learning to open up and to share with them. Luckily also I have the church that I go to and I develop, to me, very intimate relationships from bible study and Christian fellowship. This is a great way to bond with people that I feel are on the same page with me. I am still developing the virtue of love. Generativity vs. stagnation and ego integrity vs. despair is where I will group these stages in life together because one, I am not there yet and two, since I am not there yet I can speak briefly on where I am currently headed since sooner or later I will reach this stage in my life. I am in the military and though the work is unfulfilling, I am satisfied with the work I do in my life because I maintain an active lifestyle. I go to church every Sunday and I am involved in a small group discussion group where I try my best to volunteer my time and to help to develop others in their faith. Second, I am attending college and I am also going to jiu-jitsu about five days a week. So I am very busy with work related to my personal life, and I feel in these aspects of personal life I feel much fulfilled. And because I try to maintain friendships where I can best live a life I feel is honest and filled with integrity, perhaps I will be lucky enough to be able to look back at my life with what I felt was a sense of truthful living. The similarities between Erikson and Kohlberg are that both Erikson and Kohlberg separate the development of an individual into categories. However, that is about as far as the similarities go between Erikson and Kohlberg. Kohlberg’s categorization of the development of an individual are split into categories to understand a person’s development of morality. Where Erikson emphasizes the experience of the development of an individual through events as well as interactions with people, Kohlberg emphasizes the same development through the emphasis on people and societal expectations. Where Erikson views emphasizes development of a person’s character and outlook on life, Kohlberg’s theory is based strictly on morality. However, they can be used in conjunction with each other when analyzing the development of a person’s character, outlook, and morality. My morality probably could be more effectively explained through Kohlberg’s development of morality. For example, I can remember when I was around 17 or 18 and learning to organize a music band together for church. In this setting I was learning to juggle the needs of many different band members as well as church faculty. In this environment I could have chosen to have been authoritarian, utilizing a “my way or the highway” attitude, however I managed to stumble upon the attitude that I was to work in efficient and harmonious like environments where everyone was to include their input and to be made valuable. This is probably because of the fact that I was in a church environment so I know I am held to a higher standard of what I ought to be doing and ought not to be doing, specifically on how I should be treating people. In this relationship with the music band members I found I was able to get along with others as well as work to satisfy the needs of members, like working around their time schedule.

For example, I can remember when I was around 17 or 18 and learning to organize a music band together for church. In this setting I was learning to juggle the needs of many different band members as well as church faculty. In this environment I could have chosen to have been authoritarian, utilizing a “my way or the highway” attitude, however I managed to stumble upon the attitude that I was to work in efficient and harmonious like environments where everyone was to include their input and to be made valuable. This is probably because of the fact that I was in a church environment so I know I am held to a higher standard of what I ought to be doing and ought not to be doing, specifically on how I should be treating people. In this relationship with the music band members I found I was able to get along with others as well as work to satisfy the needs of members, like working around their time schedule.

Ecological theory is the idea that “human development is inseparable from the environmental contexts in which a person develops.” In essence, this idea is that human beings develop in a complex set of networks. These networks are comprised of varying levels of intimacy – from as intimate as a child’s parents or siblings to as distant as an ethnic group of peoples that share values and outlooks. These networks are all correlated and in the ecological theory the idea is that there is a hierarchy of influence between the lower or upper, or intimate to un-intimate relationships. These hierarchies or varying levels of intimacy, or as ecological theorists call levels of influence, are all interconnected in complex ways. In order to understand this concept, I have considered an example for the reader. Consider a rainbow. How many colors are in a rainbow? Seven? I propose to the reader to consider at what point does red become orange? At what point does the gradient between yellow become green? I believe this demonstrates in a crude sort of way the complexities between the levels of influence in ecological theory. The established levels of ecological theory according to Bronfenfenner or any other ecological theorist is established for the sake of categorizing established levels so that there can be a form of a basis of measurement for the reader and myself to understand. This basis should help us to understand the complexities involved in the variety of influences in the development of the lives of human beings. Bronfenfenner has established four levels of influence according to his perspective of ecological theory. They are as follows: microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems. The microsystem “consists of people and objects in an individual’s immediate environment.” This level strongly influrnces development. Consider the parents or siblings. (Kail, 2014) The mesosystem “provides connections across microsystems because what happens in a microsystem is likely to influence others.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of the interconnections between work life responsibilities and home life responsibilities. (Kail, 2014) It is easy to imagine that sometimes a stressful day at work can carry over into your home life when you come home and you still feel the pressures of managing your work life while you are at home. The Exosystem “refers to the social settings that a person may not experience firsthand but that still influence development.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of government policies influencing an individual’s life, and he uses the example of a participant using welfare. (Kail, 2014) Also consider too if there were to be a war that breaks out somewhere in another country and because the government feels the need is great for more people to serve in this war, it could mandate a draft which would, if the individual were a male, change that person’s life very quickly, though he has no real personal interactions with this government like he would have potentially had with his parents or siblings. Finally, the macrosystem. “The broadest environmental context is the macrosystem, the cultures and subcultures in which the microsystem, mesosystem, and exosystem are embedded.” (Kail, 2014) Consider the outlook on life that an ethnic group collectively share. Expressions of bereavement are different amongst the different cultures as well as ideas and roles of filial relations or of gender roles. According to ecological theory, these relationships are all interconnected in almost infinite amount of combinations depending upon the individual. It is probably not possible to list all of them and how they all influence a person’s individual development, however it is possible to gain a general idea of a person’s development through the use of categorization in which different levels of development can be “split” or attributed into sections. In Bronfenfenner’s case, it is four levels, splits, or categories of attributes. Perhaps now it is easier for the reader to see the levels of from friends, family, and siblings to as far reaching as culture and religious outlooks from a civilizational perspective. From the microsystem perspective, I was raised to be working nearly always. My father wakes up at 3:00 in the morning and comes home at 7:30 in the evening. This routine has continued for nearly 30 years. He does not intend to stop. He has placed upon me a desire to want to work, and that work is good. I also have a younger sister that is 8 years younger than me. I was like a second father to her, so I was also raised inadvertently as a man that has had experience with development of a younger person since I was constantly asked to take care of my sister through babysitting or picking her up from her school. My sister and I don’t have a friendly relationship because we are not necessarily friends, but the love is great between her and I in a deep way because of the time I spent taking care of her. Sometimes after a long day of work I come home and I still feel stressed so I will have an alcoholic drink. Although I should be learning to better manage work-life stress sometimes I come home and cope with it in a way that I feel is not beneficial to me. But every day these actions lead to a conclusion in my life. So on the days that I learn to better manage my work-life stress I find that I learn that I can be more resilient with life in general. This is good for me, and I feel that this has a strong level of development in who I am as a person, shaping my personality as well as my character. This is my mesosystem of influence. When I obtained my citizenship, I joined the military. I had a sense of patriotic pride for my new country so I felt the need to “serve my country”. If I had obtained my citizenship in a different country where serving in the military is not considered a patriotic thing to do, I am doubtful I would have joined the military as I did when I obtained my citizenship. Also, when Congress approves a budget increase for the military and therefore I receive a pay raise of around 5%, I also benefit from this situation. Increased money allows me just a little bit more freedom in my life. Direct policy changes in the government have major effects upon my life. This is the exosystem of influence in my life. Finally the macrosystem. I am ethnically a Korean. So that means I have a specific outlook on life and family that is unique to my culture and ethnic group. For example, I am expected to live with my parents in the same house even while I am married. This is a big difference for Americans. Also, I have noticed that Koreans mourn for the loss of their loved ones in a specific way. There is a lot of weeping, sobbing, and perhaps in the view of an American, a form of hysteria. This is considered acceptable in Korean culture, and in fact it may be considered strange if one were act in a manner of stoicism like in Western funerals. Erikson’s theory of development is based off of the psychodynamic theory. This theory has its basis of knowledge from Sigmund Freud. (Kail, 2014) Kail says, “…psychodynamic theories hold that development is largely determined by how well people resolve conflicts they face at different ages.” Sigmund Freud’s theory of personality development was based on the idea that “personality emerges from conflicts that children experience between what they want to do and what society wants them to do.” (Kail, 2014) Erikson elaborated on this in that “Erikson proposed that personality development is determined by the interaction of an internal maturational plan and external societal demands.” (Kail, 2014) In Erikson’s theory, there are eight stages in his particular theory of life cycle. (Kail, 2014) These stages are trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and ego integrity vs. despair. Trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, and initiative vs. guilt are the first three levels of development that occur in a young developing child. In the trust vs. mistrust stage, an infant learns to trust his or herself and learns to trust others. Erikson also theorizes that an infant also learns the concept of hope through the experience of mistrust and trust, “an openness to new experience tempered by wariness that discomfort or danger may arise.” (Kail, 2014) In autonomy vs. doubt, children understand they can control their actions. (Kail, 2014) Here the autonomy is also countered by the child’s self-doubt in whether he or she can or cannot handle a situation by his or herself. Erikson says that the child learns the concept of will during this stage, which is “a young child’s understanding that he or she can act on the world intentionally, which occurs when autonomy, shame, and doubt are in balance.” (Kail, 2014) In initiative vs. guilt, children learn to explore their environment. (Kail, 2014) This includes asking questions and imagining possibilities. (Kail, 2014) They also hold guilt since their initiative could conflict with the initiatives of others. (Kail, 2014) Here, a child learns purpose, which is “achieved with a balance between individual initiative and willingness to cooperate with others.” (Kail, 2014) Industry vs. Inferiority is when the child learns specific skills like writing or mathematics. The child learns that he or she can learn skills and to be good at them, while at the same time if the child fails in this development he or she feels a sense of inferiority in being unable to accomplish tasks. This is the stage where a child learns the virtue of competence. Identity vs. role confusion is a stage where adolescents to teenagers begin to learn their identities versus identities pushed on them by parents, peers, or society. (Mcleod, 2013) Children are learning to fit in society. In this stage, the child learns the concept of fidelity, which is to “commit one’s self to others on the basis of accepting others, even when there may be ideological differences.” (Mcleod, 2013) During this period of learning who they are, they may develop role confusion as a result of a failure to find an identity. (Mcleod, 2013) Intimacy vs. isolation occurs from 18 to 40, where the individual learns to develop intimate relationships or isolation. This stage of Erikson’s theory develops the virtue of love. (Mcleod, 2013) In generativity vs. stagnation, careers, families, and relationships become solidified. (Mcleod, 2013) If an individual fails in this stage, he or she becomes unproductive, or stagnant. (Mcleod, 2013) This develops the virtue of care. (Mcleod, 2013) The final stage is the ego integrity vs. despair stage. From 65+ onwards, the individual makes an assessment of his or her life and finds that life was fully accomplished in the way the individual desired or finds that life was lived short of the goals the individual had envisioned, leading to despair. (Mcleod, 2013) This stage produces the virtue of wisdom, which “enables a person to look back on their life with a sense of closure and completeness, and also accept death without fear.” (Mcleod, 2013) The first three stages of my life involved infancy to becoming a self-aware child. My mother breastfed me and kept me close to her side as often as possible. During these three stages I can recall a story my mother told me. She said when I was sitting in the shopping cart, I would take groceries to hand to the clerk and ask “how much” for as many items as I could. I also remember my parents allowing me to play as I wished, and having put a battery in my mouth and feeling the electrical charge from the battery, I felt embarrassed to have done what I must have thought was a silly thing. In the industry vs. inferiority stage, I remember having to be left home alone whenever it was possible. The first day I was left home alone as a result of my parents having to work nearly 80 something hours each week, I remember feeling a sense of despair as I looked out the window, waiting for my mother to return, even though it had only been a few minutes since she had left. But I do also remember getting to a certain point in this stage of my life where I was able to take care of myself as I was left home alone, to the point where I made my own meals through the microwave, played computer games, and eventually fell asleep to awake to my parents coming back home. Although I had not known it, I had a feeling of a sense of mastery in being left home alone because I remember a sense of casualness I had from being alone, even to the point of where I began to prefer that environment. In the identity vs. role confusion, I remember that my family had to move around frequently during this stage of my life because of my parents starting and failing many small businesses. I moved around a lot and found I had very few friends. I remember also asking my friends during the fourth grade if they thought I was more of a skater or more of a punk, trying to fit into certain clichés I felt I had or wanted to fit into. This stage involved me buying skating shoes and trying to buy certain kinds of t-shirts I felt were appropriate to who I was. I recall a large sense of pressure to try to fit in and to find a group of people that I felt I could associate with. In the end, I found that I was more of an individual rather than a person who identified with a group. I find that now I don’t identify so much with groups as much as I do with people who share the same ideas and outlooks on life. Furthermore, I feel I’ve developed a sense of fidelity because though I have a strong sense of what I think is right and wrong, I have begun to learn to accept others and their ideas, even if I feel they are incorrect. Intimacy vs. isolation is where I am currently in my life. I have not had a meaningful relationship with a significant other in many years, and due to my frequent moving, I have not maintained many friendships. I am also quick to reject friends if I feel they are burdening me or if I feel they are incorrect in their perspectives in life. Part of this reason for rejection is because I feel that I want to surround myself with people that I feel are similar to me and my outlooks. However, I have maintained three or four friends now that I feel are similar to my outlook on life and I am learning to open up and to share with them. Luckily also I have the church that I go to and I develop, to me, very intimate relationships from bible study and Christian fellowship. This is a great way to bond with people that I feel are on the same page with me. I am still developing the virtue of love. Generativity vs. stagnation and ego integrity vs. despair is where I will group these stages in life together because one, I am not there yet and two, since I am not there yet I can speak briefly on where I am currently headed since sooner or later I will reach this stage in my life. I am in the military and though the work is unfulfilling, I am satisfied with the work I do in my life because I maintain an active lifestyle. I go to church every Sunday and I am involved in a small group discussion group where I try my best to volunteer my time and to help to develop others in their faith. Second, I am attending college and I am also going to jiu-jitsu about five days a week. So I am very busy with work related to my personal life, and I feel in these aspects of personal life I feel much fulfilled. And because I try to maintain friendships where I can best live a life I feel is honest and filled with integrity, perhaps I will be lucky enough to be able to look back at my life with what I felt was a sense of truthful living. The similarities between Erikson and Kohlberg are that both Erikson and Kohlberg separate the development of an individual into categories. However, that is about as far as the similarities go between Erikson and Kohlberg. Kohlberg’s categorization of the development of an individual are split into categories to understand a person’s development of morality. Where Erikson emphasizes the experience of the development of an individual through events as well as interactions with people, Kohlberg emphasizes the same development through the emphasis on people and societal expectations. Where Erikson views emphasizes development of a person’s character and outlook on life, Kohlberg’s theory is based strictly on morality. However, they can be used in conjunction with each other when analyzing the development of a person’s character, outlook, and morality. My morality probably could be more effectively explained through Kohlberg’s development of morality. For example, I can remember when I was around 17 or 18 and learning to organize a music band together for church. In this setting I was learning to juggle the needs of many different band members as well as church faculty. In this environment I could have chosen to have been authoritarian, utilizing a “my way or the highway” attitude, however I managed to stumble upon the attitude that I was to work in efficient and harmonious like environments where everyone was to include their input and to be made valuable. This is probably because of the fact that I was in a church environment so I know I am held to a higher standard of what I ought to be doing and ought not to be doing, specifically on how I should be treating people. In this relationship with the music band members I found I was able to get along with others as well as work to satisfy the needs of members, like working around their time schedule.

In initiative vs. guilt, children learn to explore their environment. (Kail, 2014) This includes asking questions and imagining possibilities. (Kail, 2014) They also hold guilt since their initiative could conflict with the initiatives of others. (Kail, 2014) Here, a child learns purpose, which is “achieved with a balance between individual initiative and willingness to cooperate with others.” (Kail, 2014)<br />
Industry vs. Inferiority is when the child learns specific skills like writing or mathematics.

Intimacy vs. isolation occurs from 18 to 40, where the individual learns to develop intimate relationships or isolation. This stage of Erikson’s theory develops the virtue of love. (Mcleod, 2013)<br />
In generativity vs. stagnation, careers, families, and relationships become solidified. (Mcleod, 2013) If an individual fails in this stage, he or she becomes unproductive, or stagnant. (Mcleod, 2013) This develops the virtue of care. (Mcleod, 2013)<br />
The final stage is the ego integrity vs. despair stage. From 65+ onwards, the individual makes an assessment of his or her life and finds that life was fully accomplished in the way the individual desired or finds that life was lived short of the goals the individual had envisioned, leading to despair.

I remember also asking my friends during the fourth grade if they thought I was more of a skater or more of a punk, trying to fit into certain clichés I felt I had or wanted to fit into. This stage involved me buying skating shoes and trying to buy certain kinds of t-shirts I felt were appropriate to who I was. I recall a large sense of pressure to try to fit in and to find a group of people that I felt I could associate with. In the end, I found that I was more of an individual rather than a person who identified with a group. I find that now I don’t identify so much with groups as much as I do with people who share the same ideas and outlooks on life. Furthermore, I feel I’ve developed a sense of fidelity because though I have a strong sense of what I think is right and wrong, I have begun to learn to accept others and their ideas, even if I feel they are incorrect.<br />
Intimacy vs. isolation is where I am currently in my life. I have not had a meaningful relationship with a significant other in many years, and due to my frequent moving, I have not maintained many friendships. I am also quick to reject friends if I feel they are burdening me or if I feel they are incorrect in their perspectives in life. Part of this reason for rejection is because I feel that I want to surround myself with people that I feel are similar to me and my outlooks. However, I have maintained three or four friends now that I feel are similar to my outlook on life and I am learning to open up and to share with them. Luckily also I have the church that I go to and I develop, to me, very intimate relationships from bible study and Christian fellowship. This is a great way to bond with people that I feel are on the same page with me. I am still developing the virtue of love.<br />
Generativity vs. stagnation and ego integrity vs. despair is where I will group these stages in life together because one, I am not there yet and two, since I am not there yet I can speak briefly on where I am currently headed since sooner or later I will reach this stage in my life. I am in the military and though the work is unfulfilling, I am satisfied with the work I do in my life because I maintain an active lifestyle. I go to church every Sunday and I am involved in a small group discussion group where I try my best to volunteer my time and to help to develop others in their faith. Second, I am attending college and I am also going to jiu-jitsu about five days a week. So I am very busy with work related to my personal life, and I feel in these aspects of personal life I feel much fulfilled. And because I try to maintain friendships where I can best live a life I feel is honest and filled with integrity, perhaps I will be lucky enough to be able to look back at my life with what I felt was a sense of truthful living.<br />
The similarities between Erikson and Kohlberg are that both Erikson and Kohlberg separate the development of an individual into categories. However, that is about as far as the similarities go between Erikson and Kohlberg. Kohlberg’s categorization of the development of an individual are split into categories to understand a person’s development of morality. Where Erikson emphasizes the experience of the development of an individual through events as well as interactions with people, Kohlberg emphasizes the same development through the emphasis on people and societal expectations. Where Erikson views emphasizes development of a person’s character and outlook on life, Kohlberg’s theory is based strictly on morality. However, they can be used in conjunction with each other when analyzing the development of a person’s character, outlook, and morality.<br />
My morality probably could be more effectively explained through Kohlberg’s development of morality. For example, I can remember when I was around 17 or 18 and learning to organize a music band together for church. In this setting I was learning to juggle the needs of many different band members as well as church faculty. In this environment I could have chosen to have been authoritarian, utilizing a “my way or the highway” attitude, however I managed to stumble upon the attitude that I was to work in efficient and harmonious like environments where everyone was to include their input and to be made valuable. This is probably because of the fact that I was in a church environment so I know I am held to a higher standard of what I ought to be doing and ought not to be doing, specifically on how I should be treating people. In this relationship with the music band members I found I was able to get along with others as well as work to satisfy the needs of members, like working around their time schedule.</p>
