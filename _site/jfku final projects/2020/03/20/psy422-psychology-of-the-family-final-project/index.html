It is my intention that you all walk away from this presentation with a firmer understanding of the potentials of love and how it might not be so much just about passion and attraction. That is, that you understand this information to provide you with the ability to live more fulfilling and promising lives through your relationships here and for the future. Since we are also talking about relationships later, I will be presenting information concerning family styles and structures.

Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love deals with, no surprise, three elements of love, all of which make up the broader portrait of love. These three elements are passion, intimacy, and commitment. (01) Let’s break down these three elements. Passion can be characterized by a strong desire to be with that person, constant thoughts about that person, and of course something which I’m sure you all are very well aware of, sexual excitement. (01) Intimacy can be described as the “sharing of one’s thoughts and feelings, as well as being vulnerable enough to reveal one’s true self.” (01) Commitment has to do with the decision “has decided to forego all other liaisons and live in union with the other person.” (01) That is, they live for each other. Now that the three elements of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love have been defined, we can begin to understand the second level of analysis of love.

I will be presenting this information to high school students. From here onwards I will be writing as if I am speaking or presenting this information to high school students, so there will be a liberal use of “you” with the assumption that “you” are, a high school student. Therefore, if the information presented appears to be casual or informal, it is reminded to the reader that such casual use is the intended effect to cater to a high school audience that may have a difficult time with captured attention for prolonged series of time. It is with that intention that the author intends to write a little more casually, and a little less academically in terms of conveyance of language.<br />
Romantic Relationships<br />
There are three components of a healthy relationship. In order to understand those three components, I intend to explain to you all Robert Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love. This model will help you gain an understanding of relationships and how love fills and carries that relationship. It is my intention that you all walk away from this presentation with a firmer understanding of the potentials of love and how it might not be so much just about passion and attraction. That is, that you understand this information to provide you with the ability to live more fulfilling and promising lives through your relationships here and for the future. Since we are also talking about relationships later, I will be presenting information concerning family styles and structures. Perhaps this facilitates further understanding of where you’ve come from and how these relationships you will be finding yourself in will fit into the larger scheme of life.<br />
Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love deals with, no surprise, three elements of love, all of which make up the broader portrait of love. These three elements are passion, intimacy, and commitment. (01) Let’s break down these three elements. Passion can be characterized by a strong desire to be with that person, constant thoughts about that person, and of course something which I’m sure you all are very well aware of, sexual excitement. (01) Intimacy can be described as the “sharing of one’s thoughts and feelings, as well as being vulnerable enough to reveal one’s true self.” (01) Commitment has to do with the decision “has decided to forego all other liaisons and live in union with the other person.” (01) That is, they live for each other. Now that the three elements of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love have been defined, we can begin to understand the second level of analysis of love. According to Sternberg, having more or less of these three elements can result in various forms of love. For you boys and girls, it would be like assembling your fantasy football team and with each configuration of players giving you different results for each team assembled. What I am attempting to convey to you all is that love is a complex process. To give you a further example of Sternberg’s application of his Triangular Theory of Love, relationships that are “high on passion and love on intimacy and commitment are called infatuation.” (01) Howe, author of “Marriages and Families in the 21st Century: A Bioecological Approach”, states that “infatuated couples have a strong physical attraction and are often together a lot of time but they don’t open up to share their secrets and they don’t decide to stop seeing other people to build a life together.” (01) While the latter part of this statement I did not find to be particularly true when I was younger and dating, I did find that many of the relationships I’ve experienced were relationships of infatuation. Perhaps you all have experienced something similar. An important aspect of this model is that you’re more closely able to identify the relationship style of what you may currently be in now or what you can theorize you’d be experiencing later in the future should you decide to date. Figure 1 explains the various combinations that you could achieve with the understanding that intimacy, passion, and commitment combine to create.</p>

<p>Figure 1 (Howe, 2011)<br />
Sternberg makes a further point with his theory. The types of love that are formed through two people are based on the different expectations people have. (01) Therefore, Sternberg makes a recommendation to communicate with a potential partner in order that your expectations are not incompatible with the person you have interest in. I think it is easy for you all to fall into a relationship merely because of one element of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love being present at the complete disregard for the other two. Perhaps I am making a broad generalization but I should think that most of you are high on the intimacy or passion element while being low on the commitment element. But that is my assumption. What Sternberg stresses is the need for communication between the two parties – you, and your lover. The reason for compatibility and incompatibility is what Sternberg calls a love story. (01) Sternberg says that love stories are created in our minds that serve as templates for what people expect in the expression of love and, according to Howe, how “we see ourselves ending up in a love relationship.” (01) Love stories are typically what one might expect. According to Howe, the most popular love stories are travel, gardening, and democratic government. Figure 2 conveys what typical love stories can consist of.</p>

<p>Figure 2 (Howe, 2011)<br />
These stories are our expectations of what we see in ourselves and in our partners for love. Sternberg notes that the different love stories do not always equate into a negative result but that these stories provide points of thought for further communication for what each partner wants in his or her own expression of love. (01) It is on this basis of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love that we can build three important components of a healthy romantic relationship. They are, according to Sternberg, the three elements of love, compatible love stories, and communication to each party what each is looking for.<br />
Three Problems Commonly Faced by Married and Otherwise Committed Couples<br />
I assume that the majority of you all are not yet married. If you are already married then I congratulate you. I also congratulate you if you are not yet married. But I assume that for the most part, the majority of you all will not have experienced these problems firsthand. But you may have seen these problems from your parents or other family members and friends. The first common problem experienced by married or committed couples is infidelity. That is, they cheat by involving themselves with affairs outside of the proposed committed relationship. There are a variety of factors that are involved but interestingly there also appears to be a biological cause for this behavior. (01) According to Howe, a study in Sweden has shown that a gene named allele 334 is associated with double the rate of distressed marriage of men with the gene present in expression. Women married to men with this gene expression were also unlikely to be happy or satisfied in the marriage. (01) While there is a biological aspect of this cause for infidelity, there is also a work place related cause for the behavior, as workplace related infidelity is becoming increasingly more common. (01) According to Howe, researchers have been able to predict boredom with marital dissatisfaction approximately 9 years into the marriage. (01)<br />
Speaking of fidelity, the second common problem is financial infidelity. Financial infidelity refers to the secret financial accounts and debts that a partner withholds from the other. (01) According to Howe, “Our relationships with money tell a lot about our emotional lives, our family history, and our sense of identity. The way we handle money tells people about our priorities and those things we value most.” (01) That is then, you can see the importance of the role that money plays in a relationship, especially a committed or married relationship. Since this group I am talking to is young, you may not already have a large amount of debt. Considering this position, I hope to encourage you all to carefully consider what sort of obligations you will be willing to incur. College debt is a large amount of debt and may be a point of stress for your future relationships. I urge you all to carefully count the costs and decide for yourselves if the traditional form of college is the way for you, despite the pressure to conform and to attend college the same way as the majority of us Americans do. Even financial independence appears to have negative implications for marriages. (01) According to Howe, Loftus states that “money reflects the type of intimacy a person is willing to engage in.” (01) Because there exists a relationship between money and intimacy, Howe suggests the use of communication to “discuss financial status and their spending and saving philosophies before they commit…” (01) Are you all beginning to see the importance of the role that money plays in your future relationships?<br />
Finally, the third common problem with marriage and committed relationships is perception. Carrere et. al. (2000) found “unrealistic perceptual biases in newlyweds were key predictors of marital dissolution five years later.” (01) Remember what we learned about Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love. People come with preexisting ideas of what love ought to be. According to Sternberg it was each person’s love story. According to Howe, “partners enter into a relationship with preexisting working internal models and perceptual tendencies.” (01) Evidently, these internal models or preexisting perceptions of what the relationship ought to be is such a strong element of a marriage or committed relationship, it can be accurately predicted up to 80% to 90% accuracy whether or not the marriage or committed relationship will continue. (01) Part of this reason is the perceptual biases are difficult to change. (01) Another part has to do with the partner’s ability to handle ambiguity and anxiety in a positive manner. (01) This arises from having grown up in secure attachments to caregivers. According to Howe, securely attached couples engage in “positive conflict resolution, have reality-based perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses in themselves and their partners, are good at emotion-regulation skills, and have excellent self-insight.” (01)<br />
Society and Societal Structures Create or Contribute to the Three Problems Discussed Earlier<br />
So, what are some societal factors that contribute to these common marital problems? Concerning infidelity, and specifically infidelity in the workplace, both partners are increasingly likely to go and work. That is a significant amount of time that both partners are away from each other and interacting with other members of their peers. According to Howe, at the work place people “tend to dress more nicely, think before they talk, and be on their best manners while at work.” (01) Therefore it is not a far stretch of the imagination to consider why the workplace could be a form of an artificial environment in which you or your partner may be mislead to think that the work place environment is reality. Howe continues further, that according to Tsapelas, Aron, and Orbuch that boredom was also an indicator of whether or not a marriage would produce marital dissatisfaction approximately nine years into the marriage. (01) Boredom may also be a common symptom of the modern life. Despite the rigorous pressures to conform, to meet work standards, or in your case, academic standards, work life balance, as well as later in life when you begin to juggle debts and mortgages, there is still no doubt a sense of comfortability with life. Although the majority of you all may be quite busy with your time, there still is plenty of downtime and from what I can tell it would appear that the majority of you all spend that downtime on your phones or consuming media. There appears to be in our society a pervading sense of boredom and loneliness.<br />
This loneliness could also lead to the frivolous spending of money. Financial infidelity has to do with the secret spending and holding of separate accounts from their partners. Boredom could be a large factor in the role of that spending. Possibly even so that the boredom of their partner causes the spending in a secretive and guilty manner. Howe points out that the conflict itself is not the problem. But rather that the problems “lie in unhealthy processes that lead to conflicts being unresolved or handled in ineffective ways.” (01) So you all can see that the potential that financial spending can have on a marital or committed relationship. That is that, some of us may be inclined to spend our way out of boredom or the unfulfilled needs that we may have. Furthermore, access to credit has never before been easier. It only takes a single application to be approved for an amount of money that you or I may be financial incapable of being able to afford. And since credit has been made so widely available and the skills to manage this incredibly powerful tool hardly taught, it can be no large stretch of the imagination why credit is largely misused and abused. Furthermore, with the ease of credit people are now more likely to walk into new relationships already with debt from a mortgage, automobile loan, and college loans.<br />
Finally, for all of the information that has now been so readily available to us through our smart devices, according to my own intuition, there is very little information being accessed regarding personality styles, love stories, and understanding of one’s own personality and perceptions regarding love and relationships. According to my own intuition, the majority of information being consumed by our society is media related. So, although information like discussed earlier concerning Sternberg’s love theories and potential reasons for the common martial problems, it could be that this information is not being accessed. Although according to Howe, people that grow up in secure attachments to caregivers tend to have the positive traits necessary to maintain healthy relationships, it would appear to be to me that these traits can potentially be taught over time. What then of the availability of such skills? Likely it would be a time resource intensive process and funds would need to be readily available for couples willing to undergo the class. And it should be obvious that many couples are already facing many obstacles to attending the class, such as financial and time obligations needing to be overcome. Furthermore, couples would need to admit that a problem exists, and that can also be a major obstacle. Societally, as far as the author can tell, there are no taboos on couples that refuse to seek help for their marital commitment. In fact, our society may have a sort of “mind your own business” attitude concerning the marital problems of their neighbors or relatives.<br />
Three Social-Societal Supports<br />
To help you to generate ideas on how you can utilize resources or to take advantage of the information that is being provided to you today, I have proposed three separate potential supports to help you along with your future or current relationships. First, I propose that spouses be allowed to enter into the workplace more often as guests so that a wife or husband’s potential spouse can adapt his or her bioecological status of the workplace from exosystem to mesosystem. Bronfenbrenner’s socioecological theory proposes that the influence of the self all the way to societal expectations can be divided into four different divisions. (01) In essence, I am proposing that the spouse be introduced into the workplace so that the sphere of influence for the spouse goes from distant to great, which could potentially discourage any workplace related infidelity. How this can work is up in the air obviously, and companies may not be initially be willing to involve themselves in this social experiment, but you can learn to take initiative yourselves. If you have someone you love, maybe stop by to bring by lunch or to have lunch with him or her when he or she is off. That way you can be introduced into the workplace and so that potentially and hopefully, you can have some further influence in your spouse’s indiscretions.<br />
Second, I suggest that high school students be enrolled into a mandatory debt management class. I would even further suggest that students be allowed to enter into a pretend credit score universe and so that students be allowed to “spend” money on the card and to learn to pay it off in increments utilizing understanding of APR rates. It is obvious that money plays a gigantic role in committed relationships and because of the likelihood that most people will bring into a relationship already an assumed debt, it may be imperative for young people to learn to manage debt and to pay it off as quickly as possible in the possible chance that their future spouses carry debt into the relationship.<br />
Finally, I propose that you young people engage in capitalism. Here is a business idea. There are a multitude of tests and studies designed to gauge compatibility between two potential spouses. You can start a business that guarantees that the people you match together to have compatibility – ‘till death. According to Howe and other further studies, it would appear to be that an interview with the two and to match them together would be accomplished potentially with a high degree of probability of success. If you could offer your potential customers a guarantee of a lifetime – then you may find yourself to be very wealthy in the future. This is not a new business idea. There are many companies that exist like described above and has proven especially successful in Asian countries, where it may not be socially appropriate to approach strangers in order to get to know them. It is the author’s intuition that loneliness and a desire to meet life long partners will grow. The market will exist for such a demand, and you may find that you will ride a tidal wave of clientele. The mere fact that your company exists and tests clients in order to match for compatibility will raise awareness of the need for people to clarify what exactly they would like in a relationship, which could change societal standards, should you end up successful in your business ventures.<br />
Family Relationships<br />
Three Components of Developing Parenting Identities and Roles<br />
One component that affects parenting styles is socioeconomic status. According to Howe, parents from lower socioeconomic status parenting styles reflect the job environment in which they spend most of their time in, (01) usually involving “repetitive unskilled labor with few opportunities for independent thinking.” (01) Because of this work environment, parents from lower socioeconomic status may have taught their children to do the same to prepare them for the same future. (01) In contrast to middle and upper-middle class parents, who have flexibility in work schedules and the ability to take time off, tend to raise their children to encourage them to ask questions, think critically, and to engage in conversations. (01) For example, Howe explains a study by Lareau (2002) that lower socioeconomic parents tended to give children more free time to explore and play but expected more obedience from their children, where as middle and upper-middle class children were cultivated an “emerging sense of entitlement” (01), which is to say that the children expected fair treatment and respect. (01) This means that your parents raised you according to the social and economic upbringing they may have had. You may have thought that your parents were just not as nice as other parents, but this theory helps to explain that actually parenting styles may be greatly influenced by your socio-economic background.<br />
The second component of parenting styles has to do with Diana Baumrind’s 1967 parenting styles study. In essence, Diana Baumrind’s study has to do with three parenting styles that were discovered over hundreds of families over two decades. (01) These three styles were discovered to be authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive/indulgent. Authoritative parenting styles is known as “a parenting style that is high on warmth/responsiveness and also high on control/demandingness; the style related to the best outcomes in western cultures.” (01) Obviously authoritarian styles are low on the warmth/responsiveness and high on the controlling and demanding, while indulgent and permissive is low on both scales. According to Howe, children from authoritarian parents are “more likely to be conformists with few goals for themselves.” (01) In essence, these parenting styles produce different outcomes in children.<br />
Finally, race and ethnicity also appear to another component to parenting styles. Although studies have shown that there appears to be bigger differences in class than ethnicity, there appear to be differences here and there. For example, African American children from both the poor and middle and upper-middle classes tended to engage in religious activity on a higher level than their European counterparts. (01)<br />
Three Problems Commonly Faced by Families<br />
One such problem is the changing world economy. From 2000 to 2007 the average American family lost around $2,000 in annual income. (01) More people are coming into relationships and starting families with debt already assumed. And because of economic forces like the internet, companies must now remain competitive in many ways, partially by cutting costs, which may make it more difficult for fathers and mothers to find and maintain jobs. Because of these factors and changes in economy, families must attempt to predict market changes and possibly enter into new industries with hope that they will bloom into fruitful careers. An example of this would be cyber security. According to Howe, income is not the only issue that families face. Healthcare rises at a 20% increase per year. (01) And because of the various related medical treatment a growing family may need to receive, the potential costs for starting a family is great.<br />
Second, if both families are working then child care immediately becomes another obstacle for families to overcome. Studies have shown that American infants that spend more than 30 hours a week in child care can affect the cognitive functioning of the child. (01) Strangely enough, this same phenomenon repeated for Swedish children was found that the children’s cognitive ability actually improved when placed in the child care program. (01) According to Howe, parents in Sweden are guaranteed paid leave and the opportunity to work a part time job elsewhere. (01) Howe suggests that the same is needed in the United States, that a form of a universal health care and the ability for parents to be able to work less to instead care for the child.<br />
Finally, many families may have to encounter performing multiple roles within the family structure. Although, the studies show that having such multiple roles allows for having less stress levels over all (01), too much of the multiple roles can lead to degradation of mental and physical health. Usually disadvantaged people struggle with this, for example, a minority that is from a poor socioeconomic background that is attempting to make ends meet with multiple jobs and family responsibilities.<br />
Analyze how Society and Societal Structures Create or Contribute to the Problems<br />
As mentioned earlier, economic forces are causes massive changes to the individual and his or her family. You all are in high school now but soon you will enter the job market. Some of the jobs you will apply for then will not exist now. Furthermore, with the increase of college degrees and rising student costs, there now becomes a risk that a college degree will have little pay out. Finally, when you start your family you may be asked to hold multiple responsibilities from a variety of your peers. In fact, this may be expected or demanded due to the shrinking job market and increased pool of eligible candidates that are entering the workforce. Furthermore, rising middle class populations from emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China will add further strain on the average American to compete with these people. Finally, automation and artificial intelligence will do the majority of the menial tasks that require the employment of many Americans now, so there will be additional strain on Americans to find jobs that will not become extinct in the coming years.<br />
Describe and Analyze Three Societal-Social Supports<br />
First, we can follow Howe’s prescription for a form of universal child care system so that parents are able to afford the cost of high-quality service at the expense of tax-payer dollars. Obviously, it costs money for parents to be able to afford these services so it will cost money regardless, either through the willful act of dropping the check off to the day care service or through taxation. Furthermore, we can subsidize the amount of money it could cost to guarantee paid leave for parents onto the taxpayers.<br />
Second, schools must prepare students for an economy that will be uncertain and unknown for the future. Students need to be equipped to accept jobs that do not yet exist today. Such a project would involve having students learning to solve problems and to resolve them without supervision. A separate class should be mandatory for students to enroll in, a class that teaches students to familiarize themselves with programs that are industry standard now with high performers, like learning to program with Excel, set calendar appointments through Outlook, and to type as quickly as possible.<br />
Finally, I recommend a time management class to be taken by families. This time management class will teach families how to effectively manage the myriad of roles and responsibilities a family member may be subject to as effectively as possible. This means being able to process information and to recognize its meaning to themselves and to categorize it. This time management class will have the goal to reduce the overall stress and mental and physical deterioration that occurs when family members are too overburdened with responsibilities and roles without the effective use of tools to manage them.</p>
