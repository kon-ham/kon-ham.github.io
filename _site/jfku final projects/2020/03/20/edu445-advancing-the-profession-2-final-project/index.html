<meta name="description" content="Educate the Preschool Teachers on Professional Goal Setting Educators, Have you ever thought to sit and count the amount of thoughts that go through your mind in a single day? How about in a single hour? Let’s try counting for just one minute. Of all the thoughts that come in one ear and out the other, which of those thoughts is relevant to you now? And which is relevant to you later? There is a saying that, if you do not make your own plans for life that you will become someone else’s plan. Setting goals in your life allows you to become the main character in your novel or movie. Setting goals is what brings you from a background character into the main star. Furthermore, you are in a position to influence. As educators we may have read and studied how important it is to set goals but we may ourselves set goals too low for ourselves or not set any goals at all. How then can you expect your students also to achieve something great in their lives if you yourselves have no goals? Does the apple not fall far from the tree? Aside from your professional obligation to be the best you can be so that you can encourage your students to do the same, there are other tangible benefits to setting long term goals. First, setting goals reduces burnout and increases your ability to teach. (Bright Hub Education, 2010) Teaching is a skill that is developed over a long period of time. (2010) You will need to make adjustments in the various tools of your skill-set and going from an abstract thought in your mind into a verifiable and quantifiable statement or fact written on paper will turn fantasy into reality. Perhaps you have a friend that’s told you numerous times his or her idea for a book. Has that person ever started writing that idea down? If not, I encourage you to tell that person to “get real”. You as educators also can “get real” with your expectations and desires by setting long term goals. Not only does setting long term goals help you with the development of your skill, it also helps with morale. (2010) Learning to teach is a lifelong process and setting goals helps you all to remind yourselves where you came from and where you are going. From experience I have enjoyed looking back at some of my past goals and felt slightly embarrassed at how unrealistic and unrelated that goal was to my life now in the present. This indicates that I was veering to the side here and there. This is a normal process in life and again, the goal setting process keeps you from really getting off track. I’ll introduce to you a basic concept that we can use as a guideline for setting good goals. Let’s start with the S.M.A.R.T Goal guide. S.M.A.R.T is an acronym for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The credit for the creation of this concept is given to a George T. Doran in 1981. (Smartsheet, 2018) Let’s consider the concept. Your goal must be specific. Specifically, you can define this by asking the who, what, where, when, and why. (2018) For whom is this goal for? What is the purpose of this goal? Where is this goal to be achieved? And why set this goal anyways? Second, measurable. How will you be able to measure how successful the implementation of your goal was? This is important. You want to be sure that the goal you wanted to achieve is not just an abstract art. It must be measurable so that you can know if you and especially others have achieved it. Third, is it achievable? Are you 45 years old, overweight, and have had hip replacement three weeks ago? Then would it be realistic for you to create a goal to be an NFL player by next year? If you continue to make goals that are not achievable, you will burn out from disappointment. Know your skill level and make goals to reach them. Fourth, is your goal relevant? If you have a family and you want to start a soccer team with your family, have you thought to ask your family if they have any interest in soccer? If they hate the sport, your goal to have your family join or start a soccer team would not be very relevant. Finally, time-bound. I personally like to call this a deadline. Your goals must have a definite start and a definite end. This time-bound feature encapsulates, in my opinion, all of the previous other elements of the S.M.A.R.T goal process. If you cannot give yourself and others a definite time by which a goal is to be completed, there will never be a completion. Create a Plan For How You Will Use Staff Professional Goals to Inform Your Own Staff Development Approach Let’s apply the S.M.A.R.T goal to our preschool. You submit your goals to us when you arrive for your biannual counseling. Your goals itself are not evaluated. However, we do ask that you bring them into the evaluation process because one, your evaluator also must learn to set appropriate goals. Therefore, when he or she asks you about your goals, the learning curve is on both the evaluator and evaluated. The evaluator is asking you questions relating to whether or not your goals apply to the S.M.A.R.T goal concept and if they do not, perhaps you have something to teach the evaluator. Hopefully this process encourages mutual cooperation in the “getting things done” process for you and all of us here at the preschool. You’ve joined our organization because you feel there is something more to this center than just a mere occupation. Therefore, utilize the resources that your colleagues have. They will help you achieve those goals and to set more appropriately defined, specific, and achievable goals. Again, your goals you submit to us and your evaluator is not a part of your evaluation. Merely a platform for discussion and completion of the objectives in your life. We do not evaluate your goals because some people make exceptional liars. Goal setting is a personal objective. We could measure how well one would adhere to the S.M.A.R.T goal process but it is easy to fake a good goal. Instead, we judge and evaluate your character. We will know if your goals are real if you’re achieving them. We also assume you will be here for at least a year. This is good news for us, because our mentorship program lasts one year. That is, you’ll be given three months to decide which of your colleague will mentor you. He or she must also agree to this mentorship program and obligate one year’s mentorship to you. That person must also have been with the preschool also for one year. Furthermore, the advantage of the mentorship program to you is that your mentor will also help facilitate the achievement of your goals. Of course, your colleagues also will be aware of your goals but your mentor will spearhead that initiative. Furthermore, if you have any questions relating to work life and performance, you can ask your mentor. This relationship should develop naturally and the only difference in between you and your mentor is the amount of time he or she has spent in our preschool. The mentor has no authority over you, only that he or she is a wellspring of resources and knowledge for you to extract. Since our curriculum is group teaching, you can officially shadow your mentor as much as needed. There is no classroom assigned to each teacher. Only a group divided by a beginner’s class, and an advanced class. You may feel free to ask the other teachers and watch what they do, but your mentor will most be interested in you shadowing him or her so that you can observe and modify teaching techniques to best fit your style of teacher and to improve the overall effectiveness of your method. Identify Administrative and Organizational-Level Goals Specific – I will develop a S.M.A.R.T mentorship goal program that involves my fellow colleagues. They will develop goals and have them shared with the rest of the educators by the second week of the final submission of everyone’s S.M.A.R.T goals. They will then brainstorm and with their mentors, will achieve at least 20% of the total staff’s goals by the end of the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals. We will create this program to foster a sense of achievement within the group of educators and to encourage cooperation and a sense of purpose in interacting with one another. Measurable – 100% of the educators in our preschool program will submit a S.M.A.R.T goal program. 20% of them within the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals will be achieved. Achievable – The creation of the program is viable but the obstacle lies on the ability of educators to create goals and to follow through with the goals. Relevant – Educators will spend a significant amount of time with each other. There will be highs and lows. Having an objective to meet when there is downtime that is real and actionable will foster an environment that is growth oriented. When achievement of goals happens at the work place, the work place becomes a desirable place for employees to be. Time-bound – 2 weeks after the final submission of S.M.A.R.T goals to organize and share goals. One year after final submission to achieve at least 20% of staff goals. I will implement the program by the end of January. The final submission will be by the end of February 15. My two goals, one to create a S.M.A.R.T goal and mentorship program as well as facilitating the achievement of goals for 20% of the staff is so that I can encourage an environment of growth. I believe that connections can be made between all of the subjects of education. That is, one staff member’s goal to learn to ride a bike will have an educational connection with math and biology. The achievement of goals will encourage our educators to further their professional development. It will also make our educators better teachers. Specific – I will take the preschool organization to new attendance numbers. We currently have 35 students. I will, by the end of January 2020 have increased that number to 41 students and I will also have by then, introduced a marketing element that will encourage parents to refer other parents to our school. This marketing element will be developed by the end of February and will be implemented until the end of January 2020, for reassessment of the effectiveness of the referral program. Measurable – 35 to 41 students will be counted. I will measure the effectiveness of the referral program on the basis of how often new potential students will, along with their parents, bring along the pamphlet sheet that indicates it was passed onto the new potential family by one of our currently enrolled families. On this basis, I will measure the total amount of student families by the total amount of families that are referred. I will consider an average yearly 8% referral rate a great success. Achievable – we have the facilities to be able to house the increase in students. At the moment here we have no maxed out the student to teacher ratio and in an attempt to maximize the total number of profits legally allowed while still being able to maintain our high quality of education, we have capped that number at 41 students. At this point we will begin the development of a waiting list on the basis of the success of the referral program. Relevant – it is in the interest of the stakeholders, educators, and parents to maximize the total amount of students in the classroom, legally and ethically in order to ensure the students are able to interact with as many different students possible to increase their social experience, to increase the workload of the teachers in a professional matter so that the work is not too difficult nor too easy in order to develop a culture of purpose driven work, and to the parents so that our facility remains profitable and continues to teach the children and to stay in business. Time-bound – Marketing program developed by the end of February and total amount of students will be at 41 students by the end of January 2020. The reasons I have chosen these two goals is this – it is the responsibility of this preschool to maximize the profit. This is so that the facility can afford to maintain the high educational standard of the curriculum and so that the business can afford to stay in business. Furthermore, our educators depend on the financial success of the preschool for their own livelihood. The effects of the preschool shutting down due to bad business practices is catastrophic for parents, educators, and children. Secondly, it is irresponsible for the business to live hand to mouth. The preschool must have a pool of students to draw from when other students drop out due to the myriad of reasons life brings to the table. The referral program allows for the preschool to pick from the waiting list parents and families that are most dedicated to improving the educational condition of their child. It is difficult enough already to deal with parents that are not motivated in the collaborative process of raising a child as an educator. We will pick from the best families that desperately want to do what they can to bring the best out of their child. Perhaps the not so motivated families will go to our competitors when they tire of the waiting list. In Addition to Setting Professional Goals, Implement a Reflective Practice Model I have chosen to define reflective practice as to “strive to continuously achieve mastery of “increasingly higher levels of performance through the acquisition of more complex and refined cognitive mechanisms.”” (Marzano &amp; Boogren, 2009) This is not a boring repetition of tasks. It is purposeful and thought driven practice in order to achieve a higher level of mastery. When the children come in with high energy and seemingly continue on and on it can sometimes be difficult for educators to sit and reflect on how things could have been done better. Furthermore, how can an educator apply reflective practice or deliberative practice? To address this question, I have developed a deliberative and reflective practice program for our educators to involve themselves in. It costs nothing to start a WordPress account. That is why I am requesting that our educators start a WordPress account with their name in the website field. There is no general requirement as to what needs to be on your website, but the concept is that you will begin to write out your reflections and deliberately practice your pedagogical skills on your WordPress account. This is where you will develop further as an educator. Not only that, when you’ve submitted the many different articles, you’ll find that you have an excellent portfolio of work that, should you decide to move to another field or another organization, your potential employer can see the amount of work you’ve completed in your field. This is an excellent and low-cost solution (free, minus your time) that will help you to reach new levels. Though there is no mandatory order to have our educators make a website, a total evaluation will be made on our educators, and having a WordPress or a website account with reflective and deliberative practice on the site will be considered for high marks.

(Smartsheet, 2018) Let’s consider the concept. Your goal must be specific. Specifically, you can define this by asking the who, what, where, when, and why. (2018) For whom is this goal for? What is the purpose of this goal? Where is this goal to be achieved? And why set this goal anyways? Second, measurable. How will you be able to measure how successful the implementation of your goal was? This is important. You want to be sure that the goal you wanted to achieve is not just an abstract art. It must be measurable so that you can know if you and especially others have achieved it. Third, is it achievable? Are you 45 years old, overweight, and have had hip replacement three weeks ago? Then would it be realistic for you to create a goal to be an NFL player by next year? If you continue to make goals that are not achievable, you will burn out from disappointment. Know your skill level and make goals to reach them. Fourth, is your goal relevant? If you have a family and you want to start a soccer team with your family, have you thought to ask your family if they have any interest in soccer? If they hate the sport, your goal to have your family join or start a soccer team would not be very relevant. Finally, time-bound. I personally like to call this a deadline. Your goals must have a definite start and a definite end. This time-bound feature encapsulates, in my opinion, all of the previous other elements of the S.M.A.R.T goal process. If you cannot give yourself and others a definite time by which a goal is to be completed, there will never be a completion. Create a Plan For How You Will Use Staff Professional Goals to Inform Your Own Staff Development Approach Let’s apply the S.M.A.R.T goal to our preschool. You submit your goals to us when you arrive for your biannual counseling. Your goals itself are not evaluated. However, we do ask that you bring them into the evaluation process because one, your evaluator also must learn to set appropriate goals. Therefore, when he or she asks you about your goals, the learning curve is on both the evaluator and evaluated. The evaluator is asking you questions relating to whether or not your goals apply to the S.M.A.R.T goal concept and if they do not, perhaps you have something to teach the evaluator. Hopefully this process encourages mutual cooperation in the “getting things done” process for you and all of us here at the preschool. You’ve joined our organization because you feel there is something more to this center than just a mere occupation. Therefore, utilize the resources that your colleagues have. They will help you achieve those goals and to set more appropriately defined, specific, and achievable goals. Again, your goals you submit to us and your evaluator is not a part of your evaluation. Merely a platform for discussion and completion of the objectives in your life. We do not evaluate your goals because some people make exceptional liars. Goal setting is a personal objective. We could measure how well one would adhere to the S.M.A.R.T goal process but it is easy to fake a good goal. Instead, we judge and evaluate your character. We will know if your goals are real if you’re achieving them. We also assume you will be here for at least a year. This is good news for us, because our mentorship program lasts one year. That is, you’ll be given three months to decide which of your colleague will mentor you. He or she must also agree to this mentorship program and obligate one year’s mentorship to you. That person must also have been with the preschool also for one year. Furthermore, the advantage of the mentorship program to you is that your mentor will also help facilitate the achievement of your goals. Of course, your colleagues also will be aware of your goals but your mentor will spearhead that initiative. Furthermore, if you have any questions relating to work life and performance, you can ask your mentor. This relationship should develop naturally and the only difference in between you and your mentor is the amount of time he or she has spent in our preschool. The mentor has no authority over you, only that he or she is a wellspring of resources and knowledge for you to extract. Since our curriculum is group teaching, you can officially shadow your mentor as much as needed. There is no classroom assigned to each teacher. Only a group divided by a beginner’s class, and an advanced class. You may feel free to ask the other teachers and watch what they do, but your mentor will most be interested in you shadowing him or her so that you can observe and modify teaching techniques to best fit your style of teacher and to improve the overall effectiveness of your method. Identify Administrative and Organizational-Level Goals Specific – I will develop a S.M.A.R.T mentorship goal program that involves my fellow colleagues. They will develop goals and have them shared with the rest of the educators by the second week of the final submission of everyone’s S.M.A.R.T goals. They will then brainstorm and with their mentors, will achieve at least 20% of the total staff’s goals by the end of the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals. We will create this program to foster a sense of achievement within the group of educators and to encourage cooperation and a sense of purpose in interacting with one another. Measurable – 100% of the educators in our preschool program will submit a S.M.A.R.T goal program. 20% of them within the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals will be achieved. Achievable – The creation of the program is viable but the obstacle lies on the ability of educators to create goals and to follow through with the goals. Relevant – Educators will spend a significant amount of time with each other. There will be highs and lows. Having an objective to meet when there is downtime that is real and actionable will foster an environment that is growth oriented. When achievement of goals happens at the work place, the work place becomes a desirable place for employees to be. Time-bound – 2 weeks after the final submission of S.M.A.R.T goals to organize and share goals. One year after final submission to achieve at least 20% of staff goals. I will implement the program by the end of January. The final submission will be by the end of February 15. My two goals, one to create a S.M.A.R.T goal and mentorship program as well as facilitating the achievement of goals for 20% of the staff is so that I can encourage an environment of growth. I believe that connections can be made between all of the subjects of education. That is, one staff member’s goal to learn to ride a bike will have an educational connection with math and biology. The achievement of goals will encourage our educators to further their professional development. It will also make our educators better teachers. Specific – I will take the preschool organization to new attendance numbers. We currently have 35 students. I will, by the end of January 2020 have increased that number to 41 students and I will also have by then, introduced a marketing element that will encourage parents to refer other parents to our school. This marketing element will be developed by the end of February and will be implemented until the end of January 2020, for reassessment of the effectiveness of the referral program. Measurable – 35 to 41 students will be counted. I will measure the effectiveness of the referral program on the basis of how often new potential students will, along with their parents, bring along the pamphlet sheet that indicates it was passed onto the new potential family by one of our currently enrolled families. On this basis, I will measure the total amount of student families by the total amount of families that are referred. I will consider an average yearly 8% referral rate a great success. Achievable – we have the facilities to be able to house the increase in students. At the moment here we have no maxed out the student to teacher ratio and in an attempt to maximize the total number of profits legally allowed while still being able to maintain our high quality of education, we have capped that number at 41 students. At this point we will begin the development of a waiting list on the basis of the success of the referral program. Relevant – it is in the interest of the stakeholders, educators, and parents to maximize the total amount of students in the classroom, legally and ethically in order to ensure the students are able to interact with as many different students possible to increase their social experience, to increase the workload of the teachers in a professional matter so that the work is not too difficult nor too easy in order to develop a culture of purpose driven work, and to the parents so that our facility remains profitable and continues to teach the children and to stay in business. Time-bound – Marketing program developed by the end of February and total amount of students will be at 41 students by the end of January 2020. The reasons I have chosen these two goals is this – it is the responsibility of this preschool to maximize the profit. This is so that the facility can afford to maintain the high educational standard of the curriculum and so that the business can afford to stay in business. Furthermore, our educators depend on the financial success of the preschool for their own livelihood. The effects of the preschool shutting down due to bad business practices is catastrophic for parents, educators, and children. Secondly, it is irresponsible for the business to live hand to mouth. The preschool must have a pool of students to draw from when other students drop out due to the myriad of reasons life brings to the table. The referral program allows for the preschool to pick from the waiting list parents and families that are most dedicated to improving the educational condition of their child. It is difficult enough already to deal with parents that are not motivated in the collaborative process of raising a child as an educator. We will pick from the best families that desperately want to do what they can to bring the best out of their child. Perhaps the not so motivated families will go to our competitors when they tire of the waiting list. In Addition to Setting Professional Goals, Implement a Reflective Practice Model I have chosen to define reflective practice as to “strive to continuously achieve mastery of “increasingly higher levels of performance through the acquisition of more complex and refined cognitive mechanisms.”” (Marzano &amp; Boogren, 2009) This is not a boring repetition of tasks. It is purposeful and thought driven practice in order to achieve a higher level of mastery. When the children come in with high energy and seemingly continue on and on it can sometimes be difficult for educators to sit and reflect on how things could have been done better. Furthermore, how can an educator apply reflective practice or deliberative practice? To address this question, I have developed a deliberative and reflective practice program for our educators to involve themselves in. It costs nothing to start a WordPress account. That is why I am requesting that our educators start a WordPress account with their name in the website field. There is no general requirement as to what needs to be on your website, but the concept is that you will begin to write out your reflections and deliberately practice your pedagogical skills on your WordPress account. This is where you will develop further as an educator. Not only that, when you’ve submitted the many different articles, you’ll find that you have an excellent portfolio of work that, should you decide to move to another field or another organization, your potential employer can see the amount of work you’ve completed in your field. This is an excellent and low-cost solution (free, minus your time) that will help you to reach new levels. Though there is no mandatory order to have our educators make a website, a total evaluation will be made on our educators, and having a WordPress or a website account with reflective and deliberative practice on the site will be considered for high marks.

  <p>Educate the Preschool Teachers on Professional Goal Setting<br />
Educators,<br />
Have you ever thought to sit and count the amount of thoughts that go through your mind in a single day? How about in a single hour? Let’s try counting for just one minute. Of all the thoughts that come in one ear and out the other, which of those thoughts is relevant to you now? And which is relevant to you later? There is a saying that, if you do not make your own plans for life that you will become someone else’s plan. Setting goals in your life allows you to become the main character in your novel or movie. Setting goals is what brings you from a background character into the main star. Furthermore, you are in a position to influence. As educators we may have read and studied how important it is to set goals but we may ourselves set goals too low for ourselves or not set any goals at all. How then can you expect your students also to achieve something great in their lives if you yourselves have no goals? Does the apple not fall far from the tree?<br />
Aside from your professional obligation to be the best you can be so that you can encourage your students to do the same, there are other tangible benefits to setting long term goals. First, setting goals reduces burnout and increases your ability to teach. (Bright Hub Education, 2010) Teaching is a skill that is developed over a long period of time. (2010) You will need to make adjustments in the various tools of your skill-set and going from an abstract thought in your mind into a verifiable and quantifiable statement or fact written on paper will turn fantasy into reality. Perhaps you have a friend that’s told you numerous times his or her idea for a book. Has that person ever started writing that idea down? If not, I encourage you to tell that person to “get real”. You as educators also can “get real” with your expectations and desires by setting long term goals. Not only does setting long term goals help you with the development of your skill, it also helps with morale. (2010) Learning to teach is a lifelong process and setting goals helps you all to remind yourselves where you came from and where you are going. From experience I have enjoyed looking back at some of my past goals and felt slightly embarrassed at how unrealistic and unrelated that goal was to my life now in the present. This indicates that I was veering to the side here and there. This is a normal process in life and again, the goal setting process keeps you from really getting off track. I’ll introduce to you a basic concept that we can use as a guideline for setting good goals. Let’s start with the S.M.A.R.T Goal guide. S.M.A.R.T is an acronym for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The credit for the creation of this concept is given to a George T. Doran in 1981. (Smartsheet, 2018) Let’s consider the concept.<br />
