<meta name="description" content="What would your adult life look like when you grow up roller-skating down Fifth Avenue while your limousine drives behind you in case you get tired? What if your grandfather was in fact, the richest man in modern history? What kind of an adult would you turn out to be? Does being born into wealth turn you into a snob? Or does merely being born into the American elite only have to do with your last name? And if you never need to worry about food, clothing, or where to work, and merely having the prestige of one of the most famous last names in the entire world, are you more likely to be self-actualized? David Rockefeller’s achievements, legacy, and personality are the result of his need for achievement along the same lines as his grandfather, his social upbringing, and his ability to have the majority of his needs met through the hierarchy of needs, thereby becoming self-actualized more often and consistently than those who are not in a position of prestige. The three theories to be used as a hypothesis of David Rockefeller are as follows: Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, achievement motivation theory, and Allport’s trait theory. There are limitations, however, to this analysis. One, the former David Rockefeller is no longer here to take an Allport personality test, so we are limited in his analysis to the observations we can make from him and from others who knew him personally. Second limitation is researcher bias. I do not like David Rockefeller so I must be careful to be as objective as possible in my analysis. I do not believe there is an ethical concern to this case study because one, I draw from David Rockefeller’s personal memoirs, and two, I’m using secondary sources so whatever ethical concern one may have can rest assured be comforted knowing that the damage has already been done, and that at this point here in this research we are merely observing the remains of the capsized ship. David Rockefeller was born the youngest of six children. He grew up, went to college at Harvard, and went to get his doctorates at the University of Chicago. He was married in 1940. After a brief affair with politics he then enlisted as a private, serving abroad in Africa before being honorably discharged as a captain. (David Rockefeller, 2017) David Rockefeller was put to work for Chase bank and then went on to oversee the merging of the Manhattan bank – we now know this bank as the Chase Manhattan bank. During and after this period David Rockefeller spent his time for various charity groups and serving on the board for the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother created. (David Rockefeller, 2017) His notable achievements are the founding of the Trilateral Commission and the attending of the Bilderberg meetings as well as becoming a director on the Council on Foreign Relations. In his personal family life, David Rockefeller remembered his father as “distant” and “formal, but not cold” (Rockefeller, 2017) He remembers his own father having had a “nervous collapse” and that he remembers his Grandfather as “possibly the richest man in America” and according to David’s own words, “one of the most hated”. (Rockefeller, 2017) The existential-humanistic theory was based on the concept of phenomenology. And the men who founded this school of thought were Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Carl Rogers started the train of thought that the relationship of the therapist was helping the individual self-discover the healing process, leading eventually to improved self-esteem. High self-esteem has many positive social benefits: individual happiness (Shackelford, 2001), academic achievement (Schmidt &amp; Padilla, 2003), and supportive social behavior (Schimel, Arndt, Banko, &amp; Cook, 2004). (Chopra, 2017) The socio-emotional development theory of development proposes that the child’s future cognitive ability is based on the idea that “The core features of emotional development include the ability to identify and understand one’s own feelings, to accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others, to manage strong emotions and their expression in a constructive manner, to regulate one’s own behavior, to develop empathy for others, and to establish and maintain relationships.” (Social-Emotional Development Domain, 2017) The father of the sociocultural approach was Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky. The core approaches to this perspective was based upon the idea that children learn from their parents and culture and that language had much to do with the upbringing of the child. The language being important is that psychologists have noted that children speak to themselves while they act, supposing that the act of speaking is a memory recall technique that a child will later utilize in life. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017) The Robber’s Cave is an example of how two different groups of cultures can be taught to be antagonistic towards another group. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017) Childhood was for David Rockefeller, “a child’s paradise.” (Rockefeller, 2008) David Rockefeller grew up with no needs for food or water. There was even an infirmary in one of the floors of his father’s estate, then the biggest private estate in New York. David Rockefeller roller skated through the streets of New York with a limousine following closely behind to pick up him and his other siblings on the chance that they get tired. David Rockefeller was by all means, taken care of. It was when David Rockefeller graduated from the University of Chicago with his Ph.D. that he set off on his own, becoming a junior politician to an Army Captain during the Africa campaigns of World War II. Here you can see his upbringing as to how David Rockefeller could have been so successful, passionate, and with such achievement due to his upbringing. Many people go through life at the lower parts of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Some people who are exponentially less fortunate than David struggle to eat every day before they attempt to meet the success they search for, whether it is college or financial success. With David Rockefeller’s rolodex of 150,000 names of powerful people, (Kandell, 2017) it could be said that the hierarchy of Abraham Maslow was meet up and down the tiers consistently and without failure. He was adored by the majority of his peers and led a life of a successful political career as well as an international figure. It was no far stretch to assume then that such success brought forth more success, and was the reasoning for his longevity as well as his tireless efforts into the philanthropy and art collection he assumed well into his 90’s. (Kandell, 2017) David Rockefeller refers to the public’s term to his grandfather; that is, “Robber Baron” (Rockefeller, 2008) so it can be assumed that David Rockefeller had some sense of the distrust that the public had for the Rockefeller family. It was probably the reason why the family had distanced itself from the public, seeking rather seclusion instead of infamy. When Diego Rivera was commissioned to paint the mural for the Rockefeller Center, there must have been some sort of miscommunication. David Rockefeller, upon seeing the final painting, had it destroyed. (Wallenburg, 2017) David Rockefeller sensed that there was some sense of disrespect the painter had implied with the mural. There was, according to Rockefeller, “Unfortunately, what [Rivera] painted was different from the sketch. The picture of Lenin was on the right-hand side, and on the left, a picture of [my] father drinking martinis with a harlot and various other things that were unflattering to the family and clearly inappropriate to have as the center of Rockefeller Center.” (Wallenburg, 2017) This is probably not the first time David Rockefeller felt his family or he himself was persecuted by the mob of the public. In this very environment David and his siblings were raised as a family. His culture within his family, though very much affected by American culture at large, the looming culture overall was that of a unique culture. That is, the Rockefeller culture. How many other American families come from what is considered aristocracy? Very few. His early schooling was at the Lincoln School in Manhattan, where children from all social backgrounds came together for an education. Seeing children less privileged as he must have impacted him greatly, as his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago was based upon the Great Depression and the effects of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal intervention into the American economy was helpful to the economy. (Kandell, 2017) His wife was also dedicated to the causes larger than herself, who was “a dedicated conservationist”. (Kandell, 2017) Combined with socio-emotional, socio-cultural, and existential humanistic perspectives of psychology, we can see how David Rockefeller became the man who was involved in such large organizations such as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the investment of international banking policies through the Chase Manhattan bank. David Rockefeller was raised to wield the family wealth was respect and dignity. Kandell finds an interesting quote by David Rockefeller: ““I have never found it a hindrance,” he once said with typical reserve. “Obviously, there are times when I’m aware that I’m treated differently. There’s no question that having financial resources, which, thanks to my parents, I learned to use with some restraint and discretion, is a big advantage.” (Kandell, 2017) Furthermore, Kandell also writes:” With his powerful name and his zeal for foreign travel — he was still going to Europe into his late 90s — Mr. Rockefeller was a formidable marketing force. In the 1970s, his meetings with Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai of China helped Chase Manhattan become the first American bank with operations in those countries. “Few people in this country have met as many leaders as I have,” he said.” (Kandell, 2017) There are a few biases in this study that bear mentioning. First is that there is a gigantic negative societal view of David Rockefeller by those who know more than a few events past the fact that David Rockefeller comes from a distinguished family. This limitation makes it difficult to find research that does not have a bias against David Rockefeller. On the other hand, there are many articles that are in praise of David Rockefeller, despite his failings as the head of the Chase Manhattan bank and its profits from the bailout of New York City’s financial crisis in the 1970’s (Wallenburg, 2017), the questionable organizations he was a part of such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as the suppression of art that depicted any sort of negative view on his family as exemplified from the Diego Rivera incident. Actually it seemed to be more difficult to find neutral topics on David Rockefeller as most people who are “neutral” about him know very little about his accomplishments or achievements. Second bias would be historical bias. So far the implications of his actions have not been favorable to David Rockefeller. For example, his urging of Jimmy Carter to admit the Shah of Iran for cancer treatment was blamed on David Rockefeller for the instigation of the Iran hostage affair in the American embassy. His grandfather was accused of equipping the National Guard with weapons to put down a miner’s strike at a facility in Colorado, named the Ludlow Massacre, where two dozen people were killed. Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefeller’s brother, oversaw the oppression of the Attica prison uprising which killed 39 people. These events certainly do not help the image problem that the Rockefellers struggle with so the historical bias against the Rockefeller’s was at least tried by the researcher, to be accounted for. Finally, the bias would be the researcher bias. Through this research I have found that I have a more thorough understanding of David Rockefeller as a human being. He wasn’t a monster depicted by other people. Nor was he a saint. David Rockefeller is an example of a man whom with good intentions made mistakes that caused the suffering of other people. This is typical of all cases of men who are gifted into such extraordinary circumstances that the burden of responsibility to somehow “give it back” lies heavily upon them. I feel that the weight of David Rockefeller’s shoulders were heavy. And yet, though he tried so hard to help others who were less fortunate than him, he was still divided by such a large gap that he would never be able to understand what it would be like to be less fortunate than he was. His upbringing was an exceptional case and there are not many people who can share the experience of growing up like how David Rockefeller grew up. As a result of that, I tried my best to first look at the source material. I read through the work of David Rockefeller’s memoirs and have tried my best to see life through his eyes. I found that incredibly and yet unsurprisingly, he is just a human being. I’ve heard it said that David Rockefeller was a monster, a psychopathic tyrant. He is not. He is however, a human being that was born into a particular set of circumstances. He was most certainly not worthy of the praise of all men, however. I’m glad that I researched David Rockefeller. I feel I understand him more. It must have been difficult to live with such a sense of responsibility placed upon him at such a young age. But he like all other humans will need to have their works tested by the fire to be seen if the work created is left standing. References Burke, H., &amp; Schoifet, M. (2017, March 20).

David Rockefeller was born the youngest of six children. He grew up, went to college at Harvard, and went to get his doctorates at the University of Chicago. He was married in 1940. After a brief affair with politics he then enlisted as a private, serving abroad in Africa before being honorably discharged as a captain. (David Rockefeller, 2017) David Rockefeller was put to work for Chase bank and then went on to oversee the merging of the Manhattan bank – we now know this bank as the Chase Manhattan bank. During and after this period David Rockefeller spent his time for various charity groups and serving on the board for the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother created. (David Rockefeller, 2017) His notable achievements are the founding of the Trilateral Commission and the attending of the Bilderberg meetings as well as becoming a director on the Council on Foreign Relations. In his personal family life, David Rockefeller remembered his father as “distant” and “formal, but not cold” (Rockefeller, 2017) He remembers his own father having had a “nervous collapse” and that he remembers his Grandfather as “possibly the richest man in America” and according to David’s own words, “one of the most hated”. (Rockefeller, 2017) The existential-humanistic theory was based on the concept of phenomenology. And the men who founded this school of thought were Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Carl Rogers started the train of thought that the relationship of the therapist was helping the individual self-discover the healing process, leading eventually to improved self-esteem. High self-esteem has many positive social benefits: individual happiness (Shackelford, 2001), academic achievement (Schmidt &amp; Padilla, 2003), and supportive social behavior (Schimel, Arndt, Banko, &amp; Cook, 2004). (Chopra, 2017) The socio-emotional development theory of development proposes that the child’s future cognitive ability is based on the idea that “The core features of emotional development include the ability to identify and understand one’s own feelings, to accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others, to manage strong emotions and their expression in a constructive manner, to regulate one’s own behavior, to develop empathy for others, and to establish and maintain relationships.” (Social-Emotional Development Domain, 2017) The father of the sociocultural approach was Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky. The core approaches to this perspective was based upon the idea that children learn from their parents and culture and that language had much to do with the upbringing of the child. The language being important is that psychologists have noted that children speak to themselves while they act, supposing that the act of speaking is a memory recall technique that a child will later utilize in life. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017) The Robber’s Cave is an example of how two different groups of cultures can be taught to be antagonistic towards another group. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017) Childhood was for David Rockefeller, “a child’s paradise.” (Rockefeller, 2008) David Rockefeller grew up with no needs for food or water. There was even an infirmary in one of the floors of his father’s estate, then the biggest private estate in New York. David Rockefeller roller skated through the streets of New York with a limousine following closely behind to pick up him and his other siblings on the chance that they get tired. David Rockefeller was by all means, taken care of. It was when David Rockefeller graduated from the University of Chicago with his Ph.D. that he set off on his own, becoming a junior politician to an Army Captain during the Africa campaigns of World War II. Here you can see his upbringing as to how David Rockefeller could have been so successful, passionate, and with such achievement due to his upbringing. Many people go through life at the lower parts of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Some people who are exponentially less fortunate than David struggle to eat every day before they attempt to meet the success they search for, whether it is college or financial success. With David Rockefeller’s rolodex of 150,000 names of powerful people, (Kandell, 2017) it could be said that the hierarchy of Abraham Maslow was meet up and down the tiers consistently and without failure. He was adored by the majority of his peers and led a life of a successful political career as well as an international figure. It was no far stretch to assume then that such success brought forth more success, and was the reasoning for his longevity as well as his tireless efforts into the philanthropy and art collection he assumed well into his 90’s. (Kandell, 2017) David Rockefeller refers to the public’s term to his grandfather; that is, “Robber Baron” (Rockefeller, 2008) so it can be assumed that David Rockefeller had some sense of the distrust that the public had for the Rockefeller family. It was probably the reason why the family had distanced itself from the public, seeking rather seclusion instead of infamy. When Diego Rivera was commissioned to paint the mural for the Rockefeller Center, there must have been some sort of miscommunication. David Rockefeller, upon seeing the final painting, had it destroyed. (Wallenburg, 2017) David Rockefeller sensed that there was some sense of disrespect the painter had implied with the mural. There was, according to Rockefeller, “Unfortunately, what [Rivera] painted was different from the sketch. The picture of Lenin was on the right-hand side, and on the left, a picture of [my] father drinking martinis with a harlot and various other things that were unflattering to the family and clearly inappropriate to have as the center of Rockefeller Center.” (Wallenburg, 2017) This is probably not the first time David Rockefeller felt his family or he himself was persecuted by the mob of the public. In this very environment David and his siblings were raised as a family. His culture within his family, though very much affected by American culture at large, the looming culture overall was that of a unique culture. That is, the Rockefeller culture. How many other American families come from what is considered aristocracy? Very few. His early schooling was at the Lincoln School in Manhattan, where children from all social backgrounds came together for an education. Seeing children less privileged as he must have impacted him greatly, as his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago was based upon the Great Depression and the effects of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal intervention into the American economy was helpful to the economy. (Kandell, 2017) His wife was also dedicated to the causes larger than herself, who was “a dedicated conservationist”. (Kandell, 2017) Combined with socio-emotional, socio-cultural, and existential humanistic perspectives of psychology, we can see how David Rockefeller became the man who was involved in such large organizations such as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the investment of international banking policies through the Chase Manhattan bank. David Rockefeller was raised to wield the family wealth was respect and dignity. Kandell finds an interesting quote by David Rockefeller: ““I have never found it a hindrance,” he once said with typical reserve. “Obviously, there are times when I’m aware that I’m treated differently. There’s no question that having financial resources, which, thanks to my parents, I learned to use with some restraint and discretion, is a big advantage.” (Kandell, 2017) Furthermore, Kandell also writes:” With his powerful name and his zeal for foreign travel — he was still going to Europe into his late 90s — Mr. Rockefeller was a formidable marketing force. In the 1970s, his meetings with Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai of China helped Chase Manhattan become the first American bank with operations in those countries. “Few people in this country have met as many leaders as I have,” he said.” (Kandell, 2017) There are a few biases in this study that bear mentioning. First is that there is a gigantic negative societal view of David Rockefeller by those who know more than a few events past the fact that David Rockefeller comes from a distinguished family. This limitation makes it difficult to find research that does not have a bias against David Rockefeller. On the other hand, there are many articles that are in praise of David Rockefeller, despite his failings as the head of the Chase Manhattan bank and its profits from the bailout of New York City’s financial crisis in the 1970’s (Wallenburg, 2017), the questionable organizations he was a part of such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as the suppression of art that depicted any sort of negative view on his family as exemplified from the Diego Rivera incident. Actually it seemed to be more difficult to find neutral topics on David Rockefeller as most people who are “neutral” about him know very little about his accomplishments or achievements. Second bias would be historical bias. So far the implications of his actions have not been favorable to David Rockefeller. For example, his urging of Jimmy Carter to admit the Shah of Iran for cancer treatment was blamed on David Rockefeller for the instigation of the Iran hostage affair in the American embassy. His grandfather was accused of equipping the National Guard with weapons to put down a miner’s strike at a facility in Colorado, named the Ludlow Massacre, where two dozen people were killed. Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefeller’s brother, oversaw the oppression of the Attica prison uprising which killed 39 people. These events certainly do not help the image problem that the Rockefellers struggle with so the historical bias against the Rockefeller’s was at least tried by the researcher, to be accounted for. Finally, the bias would be the researcher bias. Through this research I have found that I have a more thorough understanding of David Rockefeller as a human being. He wasn’t a monster depicted by other people. Nor was he a saint. David Rockefeller is an example of a man whom with good intentions made mistakes that caused the suffering of other people. This is typical of all cases of men who are gifted into such extraordinary circumstances that the burden of responsibility to somehow “give it back” lies heavily upon them. I feel that the weight of David Rockefeller’s shoulders were heavy. And yet, though he tried so hard to help others who were less fortunate than him, he was still divided by such a large gap that he would never be able to understand what it would be like to be less fortunate than he was. His upbringing was an exceptional case and there are not many people who can share the experience of growing up like how David Rockefeller grew up. As a result of that, I tried my best to first look at the source material. I read through the work of David Rockefeller’s memoirs and have tried my best to see life through his eyes. I found that incredibly and yet unsurprisingly, he is just a human being. I’ve heard it said that David Rockefeller was a monster, a psychopathic tyrant. He is not. He is however, a human being that was born into a particular set of circumstances. He was most certainly not worthy of the praise of all men, however. I’m glad that I researched David Rockefeller. I feel I understand him more. It must have been difficult to live with such a sense of responsibility placed upon him at such a young age. But he like all other humans will need to have their works tested by the fire to be seen if the work created is left standing. References Burke, H., &amp; Schoifet, M. (2017, March 20).

  <h1 class="post-title">PSY221 Psychology Final Project (On David Rockefeller's wealth; did his past influence his future?)</h1>
  <time datetime="2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00" class="post-date">20 Mar 2020</time>
  <p>What would your adult life look like when you grow up roller-skating down Fifth Avenue while your limousine drives behind you in case you get tired? What if your grandfather was in fact, the richest man in modern history? What kind of an adult would you turn out to be? Does being born into wealth turn you into a snob? Or does merely being born into the American elite only have to do with your last name? And if you never need to worry about food, clothing, or where to work, and merely having the prestige of one of the most famous last names in the entire world, are you more likely to be self-actualized?<br />
David Rockefeller’s achievements, legacy, and personality are the result of his need for achievement along the same lines as his grandfather, his social upbringing, and his ability to have the majority of his needs met through the hierarchy of needs, thereby becoming self-actualized more often and consistently than those who are not in a position of prestige.<br />
The three theories to be used as a hypothesis of David Rockefeller are as follows: Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, achievement motivation theory, and Allport’s trait theory.<br />
There are limitations, however, to this analysis. One, the former David Rockefeller is no longer here to take an Allport personality test, so we are limited in his analysis to the observations we can make from him and from others who knew him personally. Second limitation is researcher bias. I do not like David Rockefeller so I must be careful to be as objective as possible in my analysis. I do not believe there is an ethical concern to this case study because one, I draw from David Rockefeller’s personal memoirs, and two, I’m using secondary sources so whatever ethical concern one may have can rest assured be comforted knowing that the damage has already been done, and that at this point here in this research we are merely observing the remains of the capsized ship.<br />
