<meta name="description" content="This study seeks to find the relationship between social learning and self-efficacy upon individuals and its impact upon professional growth of the individuals. Using social learning and self-efficacy concepts proposed by Albert Bandura, the study done by Svenja Tams suggests a few things: First, “People’s ability to engage in self-directed learning has become increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings.” (Tams, 2008) According to Tams, this increased importance of self-directed learning occurs as a result of the “broadening” of work relationships and responsibilities. (Tams, 2008). Second, the implications for a manager are this: Experiential learning can be prohibitive in that it is sometimes “not feasible, or cumbersome and lengthy”. (Tams, 2008) That is, trial and error learning. Social learning however, involves the use of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions. (Tams, 2008) However, social learning is not the final answer for organizational management. According to Tams, self-directed social learning is largely dependent upon the individual. Depending upon the individuals differences of priorities, an initiative based seeking of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions is obviously, self-directed. Some individuals would probably not be interested in such an initiative. Tams proposes that much has been written on the two ways in which an inidivudal develops skills related to the work force through “the ongoing engagement with their task and social environment.”. (Tams, 2008) In such a manner, Tams says, learning occurs in two ways. The first is experiential learning, or as mentioned above, trial and error leraning. According to Tams, this is “the ongoing reflection upon one’s actions and their outcomes.” (Tams, 2008) This thought process sometimes goes along as “was that a good decision or a bad decision?” The second way is the self-directed social learning way, which Tams elaborates upon in the study. (Tams, 2008) Social learning is the theory formulated by Albert Bandura. This theory was made famous through the use of Bobo, a doll that was used in an experiment by Bandura. In this theory, children were made to watch a video of an adult acting violently towards the doll. Those children that watched the adult acting violently towards the doll were likely to exhibit the same traits to the same doll, when given the doll. Interestingly, when the video was watched with an adult in the room and when the adult made a disapproving comment towards the adult in the video acting violently towards Bobo, children were less likely to emulate that behavior. The disapproving or approving comments the adult made while watching the video were the positive or negative reinforcements of the behavior. Saul Mcleod says that according to Albert Bandura’s theory, people are “active information processors and think about the relationship between their behavior and its consequences” (Mcleod, 2016). This relationship between the environment and the learning process implies that the cognitive processes “are at work”. (Mcleod, 2016) This means that children don’t necessarily merely imitate behavior, but rather think about the behavior before emulating it. Tam suggests that social learning behavior can be useful to the application of the organization related to business. This social learning can first, be predicted through a survey revealing a positive correlation of the traits of agreeableness and extraversion leading to high self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) This “inter-depedent self-construal” predicts social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) Organizations are constantly training new employees. These employees can learn through trial and error or they can learn through social learning. Both methods have drawbacks however social learning theory can be an efficient model to training through the use of mentorship and role models. However, the obstacles to social learning are first examined through the relationship of the individual differences to social learning and therefore those with certain inclinations with personality and traits may be less susceptible to initiative based social learning in a work place environment. This can be a drawback for some of these employees as they are not involved in the initiative social learning process. However, Tam suggest that this behavior can be predicted based off of the variable traits of Costra and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” structure. (Tams, 2008) Then what of such traits? According to Tams, extroverts are more social: (Tams, 2008) “They can create more opportunities for social learning because they engage in more outgoing, gregarious, active, and excitement-seeking behaviors”. (Tams, 2008) These extroverts also “build inter-personal relationships more proactively and seek more feedback” Agreeable people also portray such positive experiences. For a manager, this is important information that Tams suggests managers be sensitive to. Tailoring the needs of the employee with the employees Big Five traits as well as the needs of the organization is likely to the benefit for the organization in that it employs productive employees on the basis of their learning ability. The method of the study was by survey. 1,140 questionnaires were sent and 366 were returned. The average age of the respondents was 35 and held an average of 10 years of work experience. (Tams, 2008) There were five scales associated with the measurement of the respondent’s self-directed learning: relating to others, benchmarking, modeling, identifying with the organization, and distancing. The data involved extracting information from questions such as “How do you know that you can do a good job?”, and “Can you judge how well you can work this relationship [with a demanding client]?” These questions were measured on a five point scale from 0, “does not apply”, to 5, “used a great deal”. Then self-efficacy was measured through an 11 point scale, from 0, “cannot do it all”, to 10, “certain can do”. Then self-construal and pro-social dispositions was measured for agreeableness and extraversion, which was measured on a five point scale. Controls were included for gender, demographic differences, and industry sector. (Tams, 2008) The analysis “examined whether individual differences and sectors predicted the use of the five ways of self-directed social learning”, whereas the second part of the analysis involved mediating the differences between social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) The study finds that perhaps the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is not so clear. (Tams, 2008) Instead, the study finds that individual differences play a large factor in self-efficacy. More importantly, people with inter-depedent orientations, largely minorities from a collectivistic society, do not equate to success in a business organization. Tams suggests “ Even though contemporary management rhetoric aspires to relational competencies, work places are largely dominated by values that endorse an independent and assertive view of self in relations to others.” (Tams, 2008) This essentially means that the management style expressed now along the lines of “let’s work well together” is not exactly the most efficient. In fact, this work well together attitude is associated with low self-efficacy among certain employees, or for example, minority employees of collectivistic backgrounds. This means that sometimes it’s not always good to be agreeable. This sometimes can get in the way of self-directed social learning. Tams makes two points. First, inter-dependent people can sometimes “shifts attention to the external context” as a result of social cues demanding that these inter-dependent people point their attention to. (Tams, 2008) Second, a person with stable self-construal provides themselves with a “better understanding of the environment and develop their skillfulness in dealing with this environment.” So the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is complicated and the study reveals that the relationships between the two are entwined. Tams makes a few managerial implications. For those who are inter-dependent, some training could be offered so that they can build their confidence levels and assertion. For those with preference to social-learning that is self-directed, a variety of training can be directed to help focus their self-efficacy. A manager can take into consideration the variety of traits from Costa and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” theories to prepare for potential problems associated with extroverted and agreeable traits. For example, Tams mentions the problem of a successful sales manager that begins to flounder when promoted to team leader. (Tams, 2008) Essentially, Tams’ conclusions are reached with his or her statement that “Organizations who seek to build on the diverse strengths of their people may consider creating roles and performance evaluation systems that are aligned with this orientation.” (Tams, 2008) Self-efficacy is a desirable trait to have instilled in the employees of an organization for a variety of obvious reasons. Self-directed social learning is becoming “increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings”. (Tams, 2008) This changing scenery has resulted in broader responsibilities for the average employee. This self-directed learning is not just merely from the bottom up, but also the expectation now is that the responsibility for advancement falls upon the employee. (Tams, 2008) A company can present information in an organized training environment or can leave employees to learn the skills needed to thrive in an experiential learning method. The other potential method of learning is social learning. Tams suggests that social learning that is self-directed has “antecedents”. (Tams, 2008) Perhaps managers hold the hope that all employees are self-directed social learners. This would be an ideal situation for managers, since most of the managing would then be left to the employees to handle for themselves. However, the research suggests that such an idea, while perhaps ideal, must overcome certain obstacles. Cultural differences as well as Costa and McCrae’s Big Five Personality traits suggest that not all individuals are self-directed social learners. In fact, some traits of extroversion and agreeableness may keep individuals, for example, from making decisions that would perhaps make others feel uncomfortable. Tams quotes from the Talmud saying “we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are” to further make the point that even such self-directed social learning is based upon what the individual sees as certain social cues to encode or to model. Once again cultural differences or traits play an impact upon what type of social learning occurs. In this instance, inter-dependent self-construal is the framework upon which an individual views him or herself in relation to others. (Tams, 2008) Obviously collectivistic and individualistic societies shape the perspectives of individuals – each of these individuals respond differently to social learning and expectations on the job. Social learning is a desirable trait to have in an employee. But not all employees have that self-directed social learning ability or are perhaps low in that ability. This may be the result of societal perspectives of individuals as well as personality traits. A manager, according to Tams, should be sensitive to these issues in the building of training models. As they say, no one size fits all. I personally agree with Tams. Social learning is a complex process and can be different in levels of achievement on the basis of social and character traits. Although my opinion has no particular basis in psychology, I believe that extroversion itself is not enough for success in a workplace environment, just as merely being high in agreeableness is also not enough for success. Perhaps it is the well-balanced approach that leads to effective work. In my hypothetical situation, I will set up an environment that assists foreign immigrants in teaching them self-direct social learning. In this environment, the immigrants who are taking this class are to watch two adults who are engaged in a conversation. In this conversation, the adults will start with a small easy topic of conversation and eventually the conversation turns “sour” as one adult will begin to disagree with the other adult. This will convey to the immigrants watching the conversation the differences between inter-dependent self-construal and self-directed social learning. This type of scenario has to do with Albert Bandura’s social learning theory because the immigrant groups are watching two adults have a conversation. This conversation does not involve the immigrant group and the two adults having the conversation are “unaware” that they are being observed. This learning scenario is attempting to accomplish this: to teach immigrants American social cues as well as emphasis on individual preferences, even if it means to disagree with others. This learning situation incorporates Albert Bandura’s Social Learning theory as well as takes a basis of application from Tams’ researching findings on self-directed social learning and inter-dependent self-construal. Cultural upbringing has much to do with these factors so I have decided to build a hypothetical learning situation in which I propose that social upbringing is learned from a variety of factors including social learning through observation. I propose that the same observational learning processes are involved in learning new cultural leaning such as higher extroversion and higher agreeableness. However, since Tams has proposed through his or her findings that extroversion and agreeableness are not necessarily conducive to effecting work habits, I propose this learning situation teaches a balanced approach to working together with others as well as the socially acceptable forms of disagreement in the face of external social cues like for example, a person visibly looking upset from a disagreeing perspective or point of view. The methodology goes like this: No more than five participants will be involved in observing the two adults having a conversation. There will be one more participant in the group but he or she will not be a member learning new socially acceptable norms but rather will be the positive reinforcement to the five participants. As the participants watch the two adults having the conversation, the person that acts as a form of positive reinforcements will approve of the disagreement that the two adults have in the form of saying “wow, that person really handled that situation gracefully” and “that conversation really needed to happen” at the end of the conversation when the two adults part ways. The sample and participants will be a group of volunteers who are newly immigrated to the country or are working in this country on a temporary work visa. The design involves the participants watching the two adults have a conversation in a room and the participants will be watching behind a double sided glass mirror. My hypothesis is that Costa and McMcrae’s Big Five Personalities can be altered to match a certain needed threshold. These individual participants will be asked to take a survey similar to Tams’ research survey. This survey will then be repeated after the end of the conversation being watched to see if the levels of agreeableness and extroversion change. My hypothesis concludes that such behavior is malleable and can change merely based upon the observational abilities of the participants. I propose that the problems involved in this learning situation are that the surveys are the same between the participants before and after the observed conversation between the disagreeing adults. There may be bias in the survey if the participants assume that behavior was expected to change from before the observed learning and after. Secondly, it is assumed that these participants are able to speak a fluent level of English or a level fluent enough that the conversation is understood. Finally, does such a conversation have the ability to control for cultural bias and observer sensitivities? And is one observable conversation between the two adults enough for behavior to change immediately? If behavior is easily changed upon the basis of one observed conversation, then companies may be very interested in sending their employees to such a seminar or training session in which employees learn to grow in a well-rounded manner. Companies looking to develop employees that are self-directed social learners may benefit from this greatly, but I propose that the greatest level of benefit comes from the managers, who then can spend less time training employees and more time facilitating opportunities for the employees to grow on their own, or in a self-directed social learning route. Another two solutions exist here to the learning problem. The first is that employees can be trained to match the exact caricature of an employee that a company is seeking to develop. Companies can develop models of learning that teach employees through social learning to be more or less extroverted or more or less agreeable. Dependent upon the industry, a company can possibly mold employees to become more efficient in for example, salesmanship where agreeableness and extroversion can often be of benefit to the employee. Secondly, managers can also be developed and molded to fit a caricature of leadership that the company seeks to develop. So, less levels of agreeableness and less levels of extraversion can be beneficial to a leader or manager who often must make difficult situations in which not all parties may be pleased with the outcome. The opportunity to develop employees to fit the exact mold a company is looking for is obviously of interest to many people. And, if the problem can be solved quickly and efficiently, then the potential outcome and incremental gains can be massive for the company in general productivity. A problem that could potentially occur as a result of the learning scenario is that not all people are high in the ability of social learning through observation. Speaking of cultural differences, there could be a group of employees who have different cultural backgrounds, perhaps one in which observational learning is not emphasized but rather verbal or auditory based learning. What then of a participant who lacks the ability to quickly pick up on social cues to be learned from the conversation of the two adults? Consider perhaps for example a man who is on a spectrum of autism like Asperger’s syndrome. Social cues often go unnoticed for these types of people so observational learning is not of benefit to these types of people. Which goes unsaid also for other types of learning disabilities or different styles of learning for other people – which of these people benefit least from observational learning? The conclusion of the research paper and the hypothetical learning situation is this: self-directed social learning is an asset to companies that have employees with a broad range of job responsibilities. All of these responsibilities are learned one way or another, usually through corporate training or through simple trial and error. Dependent upon the company, the training that is already in place to teach workers the skills needed to thrive in the company may or may not be of effect in ratio of benefit to dollars. Furthermore, training through trial and error may eventually provide for an excellent employee, but this usually takes time and some errors may be costly. Additionally, what of an employee that burns out after an unspecified amount of time in the trial and error phase of learning? In an ideal world self-directed social learners inhabit the majority of the company and all of these employees are constantly learning from each other through observation. However, cultural and Big Five trait personalities inhibit that dream from happening. Tams suggests that these traits and cultural perspectives are antecedents to self-directed social learning. My proposal of the social learning theory in conjunction to Tams research findings was that the antecedents to self-directed social learning are attacked, molded and in a position to prepare future employees for a self-directed social learning world. Though even in such a hypothetical learning situation, there are still yet many more antecedents to this social learning but my hope is that these antecedents are also moldable. This is the hope that I have that people can learn from positive role models the best behavior and traits to make a person successful in the workplace and in the world at large. References Mcleod, S.

Finally, does such a conversation have the ability to control for cultural bias and observer sensitivities? And is one observable conversation between the two adults enough for behavior to change immediately? If behavior is easily changed upon the basis of one observed conversation, then companies may be very interested in sending their employees to such a seminar or training session in which employees learn to grow in a well-rounded manner. Companies looking to develop employees that are self-directed social learners may benefit from this greatly, but I propose that the greatest level of benefit comes from the managers, who then can spend less time training employees and more time facilitating opportunities for the employees to grow on their own, or in a self-directed social learning route. Another two solutions exist here to the learning problem. The first is that employees can be trained to match the exact caricature of an employee that a company is seeking to develop. Companies can develop models of learning that teach employees through social learning to be more or less extroverted or more or less agreeable. Dependent upon the industry, a company can possibly mold employees to become more efficient in for example, salesmanship where agreeableness and extroversion can often be of benefit to the employee. Secondly, managers can also be developed and molded to fit a caricature of leadership that the company seeks to develop. So, less levels of agreeableness and less levels of extraversion can be beneficial to a leader or manager who often must make difficult situations in which not all parties may be pleased with the outcome. The opportunity to develop employees to fit the exact mold a company is looking for is obviously of interest to many people. And, if the problem can be solved quickly and efficiently, then the potential outcome and incremental gains can be massive for the company in general productivity. A problem that could potentially occur as a result of the learning scenario is that not all people are high in the ability of social learning through observation. Speaking of cultural differences, there could be a group of employees who have different cultural backgrounds, perhaps one in which observational learning is not emphasized but rather verbal or auditory based learning. What then of a participant who lacks the ability to quickly pick up on social cues to be learned from the conversation of the two adults? Consider perhaps for example a man who is on a spectrum of autism like Asperger’s syndrome. Social cues often go unnoticed for these types of people so observational learning is not of benefit to these types of people. Which goes unsaid also for other types of learning disabilities or different styles of learning for other people – which of these people benefit least from observational learning? The conclusion of the research paper and the hypothetical learning situation is this: self-directed social learning is an asset to companies that have employees with a broad range of job responsibilities. All of these responsibilities are learned one way or another, usually through corporate training or through simple trial and error. Dependent upon the company, the training that is already in place to teach workers the skills needed to thrive in the company may or may not be of effect in ratio of benefit to dollars. Furthermore, training through trial and error may eventually provide for an excellent employee, but this usually takes time and some errors may be costly. Additionally, what of an employee that burns out after an unspecified amount of time in the trial and error phase of learning? In an ideal world self-directed social learners inhabit the majority of the company and all of these employees are constantly learning from each other through observation. However, cultural and Big Five trait personalities inhibit that dream from happening. Tams suggests that these traits and cultural perspectives are antecedents to self-directed social learning. My proposal of the social learning theory in conjunction to Tams research findings was that the antecedents to self-directed social learning are attacked, molded and in a position to prepare future employees for a self-directed social learning world. Though even in such a hypothetical learning situation, there are still yet many more antecedents to this social learning but my hope is that these antecedents are also moldable. This is the hope that I have that people can learn from positive role models the best behavior and traits to make a person successful in the workplace and in the world at large. References Mcleod, S.

Using social learning and self-efficacy concepts proposed by Albert Bandura, the study done by Svenja Tams suggests a few things: First, “People’s ability to engage in self-directed learning has become increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings.” (Tams, 2008) According to Tams, this increased importance of self-directed learning occurs as a result of the “broadening” of work relationships and responsibilities. (Tams, 2008). Second, the implications for a manager are this: Experiential learning can be prohibitive in that it is sometimes “not feasible, or cumbersome and lengthy”. (Tams, 2008) That is, trial and error learning. Social learning however, involves the use of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions. (Tams, 2008) However, social learning is not the final answer for organizational management. According to Tams, self-directed social learning is largely dependent upon the individual. Depending upon the individuals differences of priorities, an initiative based seeking of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions is obviously, self-directed. Some individuals would probably not be interested in such an initiative. Tams proposes that much has been written on the two ways in which an inidivudal develops skills related to the work force through “the ongoing engagement with their task and social environment.”. (Tams, 2008) In such a manner, Tams says, learning occurs in two ways. The first is experiential learning, or as mentioned above, trial and error leraning. According to Tams, this is “the ongoing reflection upon one’s actions and their outcomes.” (Tams, 2008) This thought process sometimes goes along as “was that a good decision or a bad decision?” The second way is the self-directed social learning way, which Tams elaborates upon in the study. (Tams, 2008) Social learning is the theory formulated by Albert Bandura. This theory was made famous through the use of Bobo, a doll that was used in an experiment by Bandura. In this theory, children were made to watch a video of an adult acting violently towards the doll. Those children that watched the adult acting violently towards the doll were likely to exhibit the same traits to the same doll, when given the doll. Interestingly, when the video was watched with an adult in the room and when the adult made a disapproving comment towards the adult in the video acting violently towards Bobo, children were less likely to emulate that behavior. The disapproving or approving comments the adult made while watching the video were the positive or negative reinforcements of the behavior. Saul Mcleod says that according to Albert Bandura’s theory, people are “active information processors and think about the relationship between their behavior and its consequences” (Mcleod, 2016). This relationship between the environment and the learning process implies that the cognitive processes “are at work”. (Mcleod, 2016) This means that children don’t necessarily merely imitate behavior, but rather think about the behavior before emulating it. Tam suggests that social learning behavior can be useful to the application of the organization related to business. This social learning can first, be predicted through a survey revealing a positive correlation of the traits of agreeableness and extraversion leading to high self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) This “inter-depedent self-construal” predicts social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) Organizations are constantly training new employees. These employees can learn through trial and error or they can learn through social learning. Both methods have drawbacks however social learning theory can be an efficient model to training through the use of mentorship and role models. However, the obstacles to social learning are first examined through the relationship of the individual differences to social learning and therefore those with certain inclinations with personality and traits may be less susceptible to initiative based social learning in a work place environment. This can be a drawback for some of these employees as they are not involved in the initiative social learning process. However, Tam suggest that this behavior can be predicted based off of the variable traits of Costra and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” structure. (Tams, 2008) Then what of such traits? According to Tams, extroverts are more social: (Tams, 2008) “They can create more opportunities for social learning because they engage in more outgoing, gregarious, active, and excitement-seeking behaviors”. (Tams, 2008) These extroverts also “build inter-personal relationships more proactively and seek more feedback” Agreeable people also portray such positive experiences. For a manager, this is important information that Tams suggests managers be sensitive to. Tailoring the needs of the employee with the employees Big Five traits as well as the needs of the organization is likely to the benefit for the organization in that it employs productive employees on the basis of their learning ability. The method of the study was by survey. 1,140 questionnaires were sent and 366 were returned. The average age of the respondents was 35 and held an average of 10 years of work experience. (Tams, 2008) There were five scales associated with the measurement of the respondent’s self-directed learning: relating to others, benchmarking, modeling, identifying with the organization, and distancing. The data involved extracting information from questions such as “How do you know that you can do a good job?”, and “Can you judge how well you can work this relationship [with a demanding client]?” These questions were measured on a five point scale from 0, “does not apply”, to 5, “used a great deal”. Then self-efficacy was measured through an 11 point scale, from 0, “cannot do it all”, to 10, “certain can do”. Then self-construal and pro-social dispositions was measured for agreeableness and extraversion, which was measured on a five point scale. Controls were included for gender, demographic differences, and industry sector. (Tams, 2008) The analysis “examined whether individual differences and sectors predicted the use of the five ways of self-directed social learning”, whereas the second part of the analysis involved mediating the differences between social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) The study finds that perhaps the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is not so clear. (Tams, 2008) Instead, the study finds that individual differences play a large factor in self-efficacy. More importantly, people with inter-depedent orientations, largely minorities from a collectivistic society, do not equate to success in a business organization. Tams suggests “ Even though contemporary management rhetoric aspires to relational competencies, work places are largely dominated by values that endorse an independent and assertive view of self in relations to others.” (Tams, 2008) This essentially means that the management style expressed now along the lines of “let’s work well together” is not exactly the most efficient. In fact, this work well together attitude is associated with low self-efficacy among certain employees, or for example, minority employees of collectivistic backgrounds. This means that sometimes it’s not always good to be agreeable. This sometimes can get in the way of self-directed social learning. Tams makes two points. First, inter-dependent people can sometimes “shifts attention to the external context” as a result of social cues demanding that these inter-dependent people point their attention to. (Tams, 2008) Second, a person with stable self-construal provides themselves with a “better understanding of the environment and develop their skillfulness in dealing with this environment.” So the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is complicated and the study reveals that the relationships between the two are entwined. Tams makes a few managerial implications. For those who are inter-dependent, some training could be offered so that they can build their confidence levels and assertion. For those with preference to social-learning that is self-directed, a variety of training can be directed to help focus their self-efficacy. A manager can take into consideration the variety of traits from Costa and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” theories to prepare for potential problems associated with extroverted and agreeable traits. For example, Tams mentions the problem of a successful sales manager that begins to flounder when promoted to team leader. (Tams, 2008) Essentially, Tams’ conclusions are reached with his or her statement that “Organizations who seek to build on the diverse strengths of their people may consider creating roles and performance evaluation systems that are aligned with this orientation.” (Tams, 2008) Self-efficacy is a desirable trait to have instilled in the employees of an organization for a variety of obvious reasons. Self-directed social learning is becoming “increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings”. (Tams, 2008) This changing scenery has resulted in broader responsibilities for the average employee. This self-directed learning is not just merely from the bottom up, but also the expectation now is that the responsibility for advancement falls upon the employee. (Tams, 2008) A company can present information in an organized training environment or can leave employees to learn the skills needed to thrive in an experiential learning method. The other potential method of learning is social learning. Tams suggests that social learning that is self-directed has “antecedents”. (Tams, 2008) Perhaps managers hold the hope that all employees are self-directed social learners. This would be an ideal situation for managers, since most of the managing would then be left to the employees to handle for themselves. However, the research suggests that such an idea, while perhaps ideal, must overcome certain obstacles. Cultural differences as well as Costa and McCrae’s Big Five Personality traits suggest that not all individuals are self-directed social learners. In fact, some traits of extroversion and agreeableness may keep individuals, for example, from making decisions that would perhaps make others feel uncomfortable. Tams quotes from the Talmud saying “we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are” to further make the point that even such self-directed social learning is based upon what the individual sees as certain social cues to encode or to model. Once again cultural differences or traits play an impact upon what type of social learning occurs. In this instance, inter-dependent self-construal is the framework upon which an individual views him or herself in relation to others. (Tams, 2008) Obviously collectivistic and individualistic societies shape the perspectives of individuals – each of these individuals respond differently to social learning and expectations on the job. Social learning is a desirable trait to have in an employee. But not all employees have that self-directed social learning ability or are perhaps low in that ability. This may be the result of societal perspectives of individuals as well as personality traits. A manager, according to Tams, should be sensitive to these issues in the building of training models. As they say, no one size fits all. I personally agree with Tams. Social learning is a complex process and can be different in levels of achievement on the basis of social and character traits. Although my opinion has no particular basis in psychology, I believe that extroversion itself is not enough for success in a workplace environment, just as merely being high in agreeableness is also not enough for success. Perhaps it is the well-balanced approach that leads to effective work. In my hypothetical situation, I will set up an environment that assists foreign immigrants in teaching them self-direct social learning. In this environment, the immigrants who are taking this class are to watch two adults who are engaged in a conversation. In this conversation, the adults will start with a small easy topic of conversation and eventually the conversation turns “sour” as one adult will begin to disagree with the other adult. This will convey to the immigrants watching the conversation the differences between inter-dependent self-construal and self-directed social learning. This type of scenario has to do with Albert Bandura’s social learning theory because the immigrant groups are watching two adults have a conversation. This conversation does not involve the immigrant group and the two adults having the conversation are “unaware” that they are being observed. This learning scenario is attempting to accomplish this: to teach immigrants American social cues as well as emphasis on individual preferences, even if it means to disagree with others. This learning situation incorporates Albert Bandura’s Social Learning theory as well as takes a basis of application from Tams’ researching findings on self-directed social learning and inter-dependent self-construal. Cultural upbringing has much to do with these factors so I have decided to build a hypothetical learning situation in which I propose that social upbringing is learned from a variety of factors including social learning through observation. I propose that the same observational learning processes are involved in learning new cultural leaning such as higher extroversion and higher agreeableness. However, since Tams has proposed through his or her findings that extroversion and agreeableness are not necessarily conducive to effecting work habits, I propose this learning situation teaches a balanced approach to working together with others as well as the socially acceptable forms of disagreement in the face of external social cues like for example, a person visibly looking upset from a disagreeing perspective or point of view. The methodology goes like this: No more than five participants will be involved in observing the two adults having a conversation. There will be one more participant in the group but he or she will not be a member learning new socially acceptable norms but rather will be the positive reinforcement to the five participants. As the participants watch the two adults having the conversation, the person that acts as a form of positive reinforcements will approve of the disagreement that the two adults have in the form of saying “wow, that person really handled that situation gracefully” and “that conversation really needed to happen” at the end of the conversation when the two adults part ways. The sample and participants will be a group of volunteers who are newly immigrated to the country or are working in this country on a temporary work visa. The design involves the participants watching the two adults have a conversation in a room and the participants will be watching behind a double sided glass mirror. My hypothesis is that Costa and McMcrae’s Big Five Personalities can be altered to match a certain needed threshold. These individual participants will be asked to take a survey similar to Tams’ research survey. This survey will then be repeated after the end of the conversation being watched to see if the levels of agreeableness and extroversion change. My hypothesis concludes that such behavior is malleable and can change merely based upon the observational abilities of the participants. I propose that the problems involved in this learning situation are that the surveys are the same between the participants before and after the observed conversation between the disagreeing adults. There may be bias in the survey if the participants assume that behavior was expected to change from before the observed learning and after. Secondly, it is assumed that these participants are able to speak a fluent level of English or a level fluent enough that the conversation is understood. Finally, does such a conversation have the ability to control for cultural bias and observer sensitivities? And is one observable conversation between the two adults enough for behavior to change immediately? If behavior is easily changed upon the basis of one observed conversation, then companies may be very interested in sending their employees to such a seminar or training session in which employees learn to grow in a well-rounded manner. Companies looking to develop employees that are self-directed social learners may benefit from this greatly, but I propose that the greatest level of benefit comes from the managers, who then can spend less time training employees and more time facilitating opportunities for the employees to grow on their own, or in a self-directed social learning route.

  <p>This study seeks to find the relationship between social learning and self-efficacy upon individuals and its impact upon professional growth of the individuals.

Tam suggests that social learning behavior can be useful to the application of the organization related to business. This social learning can first, be predicted through a survey revealing a positive correlation of the traits of agreeableness and extraversion leading to high self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) This “inter-depedent self-construal” predicts social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) Organizations are constantly training new employees. These employees can learn through trial and error or they can learn through social learning. Both methods have drawbacks however social learning theory can be an efficient model to training through the use of mentorship and role models.

However, Tam suggest that this behavior can be predicted based off of the variable traits of Costra and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” structure. (Tams, 2008) Then what of such traits? According to Tams, extroverts are more social: (Tams, 2008) “They can create more opportunities for social learning because they engage in more outgoing, gregarious, active, and excitement-seeking behaviors”. (Tams, 2008) These extroverts also “build inter-personal relationships more proactively and seek more feedback” Agreeable people also portray such positive experiences. For a manager, this is important information that Tams suggests managers be sensitive to. Tailoring the needs of the employee with the employees Big Five traits as well as the needs of the organization is likely to the benefit for the organization in that it employs productive employees on the basis of their learning ability.<br />
The method of the study was by survey. 1,140 questionnaires were sent and 366 were returned. The average age of the respondents was 35 and held an average of 10 years of work experience. (Tams, 2008) There were five scales associated with the measurement of the respondent’s self-directed learning: relating to others, benchmarking, modeling, identifying with the organization, and distancing. The data involved extracting information from questions such as “How do you know that you can do a good job?”, and “Can you judge how well you can work this relationship [with a demanding client]?” These questions were measured on a five point scale from 0, “does not apply”, to 5, “used a great deal”. Then self-efficacy was measured through an 11 point scale, from 0, “cannot do it all”, to 10, “certain can do”. Then self-construal and pro-social dispositions was measured for agreeableness and extraversion, which was measured on a five point scale. Controls were included for gender, demographic differences, and industry sector. (Tams, 2008) The analysis “examined whether individual differences and sectors predicted the use of the five ways of self-directed social learning”, whereas the second part of the analysis involved mediating the differences between social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008)<br />
The study finds that perhaps the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is not so clear. (Tams, 2008) Instead, the study finds that individual differences play a large factor in self-efficacy. More importantly, people with inter-depedent orientations, largely minorities from a collectivistic society, do not equate to success in a business organization. Tams suggests “ Even though contemporary management rhetoric aspires to relational competencies, work places are largely dominated by values that endorse an independent and assertive view of self in relations to others.” (Tams, 2008) This essentially means that the management style expressed now along the lines of “let’s work well together” is not exactly the most efficient. In fact, this work well together attitude is associated with low self-efficacy among certain employees, or for example, minority employees of collectivistic backgrounds. This means that sometimes it’s not always good to be agreeable. This sometimes can get in the way of self-directed social learning. Tams makes two points. First, inter-dependent people can sometimes “shifts attention to the external context” as a result of social cues demanding that these inter-dependent people point their attention to. (Tams, 2008) Second, a person with stable self-construal provides themselves with a “better understanding of the environment and develop their skillfulness in dealing with this environment.”<br />
So the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is complicated and the study reveals that the relationships between the two are entwined. Tams makes a few managerial implications. For those who are inter-dependent, some training could be offered so that they can build their confidence levels and assertion. For those with preference to social-learning that is self-directed, a variety of training can be directed to help focus their self-efficacy. A manager can take into consideration the variety of traits from Costa and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” theories to prepare for potential problems associated with extroverted and agreeable traits. For example, Tams mentions the problem of a successful sales manager that begins to flounder when promoted to team leader. (Tams, 2008) Essentially, Tams’ conclusions are reached with his or her statement that “Organizations who seek to build on the diverse strengths of their people may consider creating roles and performance evaluation systems that are aligned with this orientation.” (Tams, 2008)<br />
Self-efficacy is a desirable trait to have instilled in the employees of an organization for a variety of obvious reasons. Self-directed social learning is becoming “increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings”. (Tams, 2008) This changing scenery has resulted in broader responsibilities for the average employee. This self-directed learning is not just merely from the bottom up, but also the expectation now is that the responsibility for advancement falls upon the employee. (Tams, 2008) A company can present information in an organized training environment or can leave employees to learn the skills needed to thrive in an experiential learning method. The other potential method of learning is social learning. Tams suggests that social learning that is self-directed has “antecedents”. (Tams, 2008) Perhaps managers hold the hope that all employees are self-directed social learners. This would be an ideal situation for managers, since most of the managing would then be left to the employees to handle for themselves. However, the research suggests that such an idea, while perhaps ideal, must overcome certain obstacles. Cultural differences as well as Costa and McCrae’s Big Five Personality traits suggest that not all individuals are self-directed social learners. In fact, some traits of extroversion and agreeableness may keep individuals, for example, from making decisions that would perhaps make others feel uncomfortable. Tams quotes from the Talmud saying “we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are” to further make the point that even such self-directed social learning is based upon what the individual sees as certain social cues to encode or to model. Once again cultural differences or traits play an impact upon what type of social learning occurs. In this instance, inter-dependent self-construal is the framework upon which an individual views him or herself in relation to others. (Tams, 2008) Obviously collectivistic and individualistic societies shape the perspectives of individuals – each of these individuals respond differently to social learning and expectations on the job.<br />
Social learning is a desirable trait to have in an employee. But not all employees have that self-directed social learning ability or are perhaps low in that ability. This may be the result of societal perspectives of individuals as well as personality traits. A manager, according to Tams, should be sensitive to these issues in the building of training models. As they say, no one size fits all. I personally agree with Tams. Social learning is a complex process and can be different in levels of achievement on the basis of social and character traits. Although my opinion has no particular basis in psychology, I believe that extroversion itself is not enough for success in a workplace environment, just as merely being high in agreeableness is also not enough for success. Perhaps it is the well-balanced approach that leads to effective work.</p>

<p>In my hypothetical situation, I will set up an environment that assists foreign immigrants in teaching them self-direct social learning. In this environment, the immigrants who are taking this class are to watch two adults who are engaged in a conversation. In this conversation, the adults will start with a small easy topic of conversation and eventually the conversation turns “sour” as one adult will begin to disagree with the other adult. This will convey to the immigrants watching the conversation the differences between inter-dependent self-construal and self-directed social learning. This type of scenario has to do with Albert Bandura’s social learning theory because the immigrant groups are watching two adults have a conversation. This conversation does not involve the immigrant group and the two adults having the conversation are “unaware” that they are being observed. This learning scenario is attempting to accomplish this: to teach immigrants American social cues as well as emphasis on individual preferences, even if it means to disagree with others.<br />
This learning situation incorporates Albert Bandura’s Social Learning theory as well as takes a basis of application from Tams’ researching findings on self-directed social learning and inter-dependent self-construal. Cultural upbringing has much to do with these factors so I have decided to build a hypothetical learning situation in which I propose that social upbringing is learned from a variety of factors including social learning through observation. I propose that the same observational learning processes are involved in learning new cultural leaning such as higher extroversion and higher agreeableness. However, since Tams has proposed through his or her findings that extroversion and agreeableness are not necessarily conducive to effecting work habits, I propose this learning situation teaches a balanced approach to working together with others as well as the socially acceptable forms of disagreement in the face of external social cues like for example, a person visibly looking upset from a disagreeing perspective or point of view.<br />
The methodology goes like this: No more than five participants will be involved in observing the two adults having a conversation. There will be one more participant in the group but he or she will not be a member learning new socially acceptable norms but rather will be the positive reinforcement to the five participants. As the participants watch the two adults having the conversation, the person that acts as a form of positive reinforcements will approve of the disagreement that the two adults have in the form of saying “wow, that person really handled that situation gracefully” and “that conversation really needed to happen” at the end of the conversation when the two adults part ways. The sample and participants will be a group of volunteers who are newly immigrated to the country or are working in this country on a temporary work visa. The design involves the participants watching the two adults have a conversation in a room and the participants will be watching behind a double sided glass mirror.<br />
My hypothesis is that Costa and McMcrae’s Big Five Personalities can be altered to match a certain needed threshold. These individual participants will be asked to take a survey similar to Tams’ research survey. This survey will then be repeated after the end of the conversation being watched to see if the levels of agreeableness and extroversion change. My hypothesis concludes that such behavior is malleable and can change merely based upon the observational abilities of the participants.<br />
I propose that the problems involved in this learning situation are that the surveys are the same between the participants before and after the observed conversation between the disagreeing adults. There may be bias in the survey if the participants assume that behavior was expected to change from before the observed learning and after. Secondly, it is assumed that these participants are able to speak a fluent level of English or a level fluent enough that the conversation is understood. Finally, does such a conversation have the ability to control for cultural bias and observer sensitivities? And is one observable conversation between the two adults enough for behavior to change immediately?<br />
If behavior is easily changed upon the basis of one observed conversation, then companies may be very interested in sending their employees to such a seminar or training session in which employees learn to grow in a well-rounded manner. Companies looking to develop employees that are self-directed social learners may benefit from this greatly, but I propose that the greatest level of benefit comes from the managers, who then can spend less time training employees and more time facilitating opportunities for the employees to grow on their own, or in a self-directed social learning route.<br />
Another two solutions exist here to the learning problem. The first is that employees can be trained to match the exact caricature of an employee that a company is seeking to develop. Companies can develop models of learning that teach employees through social learning to be more or less extroverted or more or less agreeable. Dependent upon the industry, a company can possibly mold employees to become more efficient in for example, salesmanship where agreeableness and extroversion can often be of benefit to the employee. Secondly, managers can also be developed and molded to fit a caricature of leadership that the company seeks to develop. So, less levels of agreeableness and less levels of extraversion can be beneficial to a leader or manager who often must make difficult situations in which not all parties may be pleased with the outcome. The opportunity to develop employees to fit the exact mold a company is looking for is obviously of interest to many people. And, if the problem can be solved quickly and efficiently, then the potential outcome and incremental gains can be massive for the company in general productivity.<br />
A problem that could potentially occur as a result of the learning scenario is that not all people are high in the ability of social learning through observation. Speaking of cultural differences, there could be a group of employees who have different cultural backgrounds, perhaps one in which observational learning is not emphasized but rather verbal or auditory based learning. What then of a participant who lacks the ability to quickly pick up on social cues to be learned from the conversation of the two adults? Consider perhaps for example a man who is on a spectrum of autism like Asperger’s syndrome. Social cues often go unnoticed for these types of people so observational learning is not of benefit to these types of people. Which goes unsaid also for other types of learning disabilities or different styles of learning for other people – which of these people benefit least from observational learning?<br />
The conclusion of the research paper and the hypothetical learning situation is this: self-directed social learning is an asset to companies that have employees with a broad range of job responsibilities. All of these responsibilities are learned one way or another, usually through corporate training or through simple trial and error. Dependent upon the company, the training that is already in place to teach workers the skills needed to thrive in the company may or may not be of effect in ratio of benefit to dollars. Furthermore, training through trial and error may eventually provide for an excellent employee, but this usually takes time and some errors may be costly. Additionally, what of an employee that burns out after an unspecified amount of time in the trial and error phase of learning? In an ideal world self-directed social learners inhabit the majority of the company and all of these employees are constantly learning from each other through observation. However, cultural and Big Five trait personalities inhibit that dream from happening. Tams suggests that these traits and cultural perspectives are antecedents to self-directed social learning. My proposal of the social learning theory in conjunction to Tams research findings was that the antecedents to self-directed social learning are attacked, molded and in a position to prepare future employees for a self-directed social learning world. Though even in such a hypothetical learning situation, there are still yet many more antecedents to this social learning but my hope is that these antecedents are also moldable. This is the hope that I have that people can learn from positive role models the best behavior and traits to make a person successful in the workplace and in the world at large.</p>
