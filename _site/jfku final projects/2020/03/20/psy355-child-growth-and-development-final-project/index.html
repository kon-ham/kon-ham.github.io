<meta name="description" content="“Developmental psychology is a scientific approach which aims to explain growth, change, and consistency through the lifespan. Developmental psychology looks at how thinking, feeling, and behavior change throughout a person’s life.” (Mcleod, 2012) This theory of developmental psychology mostly builds on theories related to a person’s childhood, as “this is the period during an individual’s lifespan when the most change occurs.” (Mcleod, 2012) The theories developed by researchers like Vygotsky, Piaget, and many others point to the fundamental purpose of the theories of developmental psychology – that is, the relationship of people and environment and that “humans seek meaningful interactions with the environment and construct knowledge of themselves and the world around them through these interactions.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) And since mentioned previously that the majority of theories of developmental psychology focus on the importance of childhood and the many changes that occur during this period, (Mcleod, 2012) it is important to understand another factor related to developmental psychology – that children grow up to be adults that function in a society and sharing that society with other human beings. In any and every society a variety of influences affect a human being in his or her outlook of the world, not to mention an exponential amount of influences related to genetics and biology that also affect a human being’s development. According to developmental psychology, this is known as the environment, or nature. And so developmental psychology seeks to explain how much of an impact environment, or nature, has in the role of the development of a human being. Perhaps human beings teach and raise children because of an innate need to express a lineage and a form of continuity of thought. Developmental psychology also seeks to explain how much of an impact human beings have upon others. Because there is a wide margin of differences between human beings and at the same time a form of consistency in the development of human beings, developmental psychology arose as a need to explain the impact of these factors and its relationships with human beings. Specifically, this exposition of developmental psychology will too follow in the focus of the broader perspective and theories of developmental psychology – it will focus on childhood and the development thereof, and specifically two theories which explain the development of childhood between the first two years of life, the years of life between two and six, and the analyzing of the effects of cognitive, language, and social development of a child with the explanation of the two theories. Those two theories are the theories proposed by Vygotsky and Piaget. Piaget was born in Switzerland. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Not only was he involved in the developmental psychology realm as a behavioral psychologist, he also was a biologist, and a philosopher. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It was in the 1960’s and 1970’s that his theories became widely accepted. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) A self-described genetic epistemologist, he focused his work on how biology and the formation of how children think and act played a role on each other. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This was his desire that he formed a general theory of such development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work cannot be overstated. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His theories were a profound change of the pattern of thought at the time, which viewed that children are just smaller versions of adults. (Cherry, 2006) And though he likely lived through the influence and impact of Freudian and Jungian psychology, Piaget took a different approach to the perspective of the development of children. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, not all of his theories rejected Freudian psychology – (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) specifically that the development of children could be explained in a series of stages. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, Piaget differs from Freudian psychology in that the repression of sexuality in the development of a human being is largely ignored and instead Piaget proposes that children are active learners engaged in the adding and modifying of cognitive structures, which are, according to Piaget, known as schemas. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) His second theory is the development of a model of cognitive developmental stages. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Schemas are the “mental and physical actions involved in understanding and knowing.” (Cherry, 2006) Inside this schema are two further concepts: the category of knowledge and the process of obtaining that knowledge. (Cherry, 2006) These two concepts can be summarized as the process of adaption. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Specifically, adaptation is “predicated on the belief that the building of knowledge is a continuous activity of self-construction; as a person interacts with the new environment, knowledge is invented and manipulated into cognitive structures.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) When a “discrepancy” is found in the environment, a human being, according to Piaget, resorts to one of two facilities: assimilation or accommodation. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Assimilation is the process by which the perception of the environment is changed to fit the mold of a previously existing schema, or structure of understanding of cognitive thought by which a person navigates the world. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The second facility is known as accommodation, which is that the actual schema, or the previously mentioned structure of cognitive thought, is changed or modified to fit a new way of understanding the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Whatever way is chosen, the path is chosen by way of interaction with the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This decision occurs as a result of a desire to reach a harmony of understanding between the environment and the existing mental schema, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) or the “force which moves development along.” (Mcleod, 2007) This process of equilibrium is not a progressive state that develops in a linear fashion. (Mcleod, 2007) Instead, this process moves in “leaps and bounds.” (Mcleod, 2007) To further explain equilibrium an example can be given. A human being experiences disequilibrium, or an unpleasant state of being, when an existing mental schema does not match with the environment that was experienced by the human. (Mcleod, 2007) This learning process, equilibrium, or the desire to depart of an unpleasant state of existence, drives along learning because human beings “do not like to be frustrated” and “will seek to restore balance by mastering the new challenge (accommodation). (Mcleod, 2007) Once the equilibrium is achieved again through the process of assimilation into the new mental schema, or through the process of accommodation, the new schema continues until change is required. (Mcleod, 2007) The second portion of Piaget’s theory of development has to do with his model of cognitive development. There are four pieces of cognitive development according to Piaget: the sensorimotor stage, the pre-operational stage, the concrete stage, and the formal operational stage. (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, every child goes through these four stages in the same order. (Mcleod, 2007) Differences in the development relates to “biological maturation and interaction with the environment.” (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, though no stages can be left out, there are differences in the timing, or rate of the succession of the model, some individuals never graduate past a certain level, particularly the latter stages. (Mcleod, 2007) In all four of these stages, according to Piaget, there are three types of knowledge that are present. They are, physical, logical-mathematical, and social. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) All three of these types of knowledge are gained from interaction with the environment. This means that these non-hierarchical processes are at work in all four of the hierarchical stages of development in Piaget’s model. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The sensorimotor stage lasts from birth to age two. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The use of symbols is not involved in the process by which the infant navigates the world. Instead, the infant depends on physical and motor activity. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This is the main form of interaction for the infant. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Around the period of seven months, an infant may begin to understand the concept of object permanence, which is that objects can exist even if they are not physically seen. This requires the ability to understand abstract concepts. The second stage is the preoperational stage. This begins at around age two and ends around age seven. Symbolic thinking is becoming to be unlocked and the toddler now understands that symbols, words or pictures can be used to represent objects. (Cherry, 2006) Toddlers are still egocentric and struggle to take the view of others. (Cherry, 2006) This can be witnessed through the one way style of communication that toddlers express, or a lack of exchange of information. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Language use is becoming more prevalent. Pretend play can be witnessed since the use of imagination and memory has been a developing feature. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Although logic is slowly forming, a child’s ability to handle logic is mostly “monological”, or that they can only understand one aspect of a logical problem at a time. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The third stage is the concrete operational stage which lasts from around seven to eleven years. The concept of constancy, which the toddler had previously struggled with in the preoperational stage, is now fully developed in the concrete operational stage. (Cherry, 2006) That is, that constancy having to do with the ability to understand that different sizes relating to volume and mass do not have so much to do with shape. For example, when a glass of water of equal volume is poured into two cups, the infant tends to choose the taller cup believing that the taller cup holds more liquid though the volumes of both the short and tall cup are the same. Egocentrism begins to disappear. (Cherry, 2006) Though logic is becoming more developed, abstract and hypothetical concepts are still struggled with. (Cherry, 2006) Furthermore, a child begins to understand that the thoughts he or she holds can be unique to him or her and that those same thoughts are not always shared with by others. (Cherry, 2006) Finally, the fourth stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development is the formal operational stage, which lasts from 12 and throughout adulthood. At this stage young children and young adults are beginning to “think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.” (Cherry, 2006) The ability to “see multiple potential situations” is developed. Sometimes a type of egocentric thinking reoccurs. (Think of the moody, “Woe is me” teenager stage.) Intelligence is shown through the use of “logical symbols related to abstract concepts.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This stage is not always achieved – it was shown in later experiments. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Researchers Eylon and Linn categorized high school students according to Piaget’s developmental model and found that “most students have not attained formal operations stage by the time they get out of high school, let alone at age fifteen when Piaget states that most young people should have attained it.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Furthermore, Piaget stressed the importance of the difference between qualitative information and quantitative information related to these stages of development. That is, that information is not quantitative, or that information is not constantly being added to a child, but rather than the information is qualitative, or that the information simply becomes higher quality. (Cherry, 2006) Lev Semenovich Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that lived through the Russian Revolution. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Though the final work of Vygotsky did not reach full, worldwide recognition until around 1962 when his work was fully published, (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) his work was recognized, renowned, and influential in what now called Social Development Theory. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky’s theory holds that “no single principle can account for development.” (Mcleod, 2008) Furthermore, individual development “cannot be understood without reference to the social and cultural context within which it is embedded.” (Mcleod, 2008) Even higher metal processes are caused as a result of social processes. (Mcleod, 2008) So it is the social interaction with what is defined by Vygotsky as “More Knowledgeable Other”, or “MKO” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) that cognitive development is advanced in children. To quote Vygotsky in his own words, “the development of the mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Shortly put, according to Vygotsky, social interaction is the backbone, or framework, “for all learning and development”. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work can be divided into three major parts or principles. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The first principle is that social interaction progresses cognitive development. It is critical. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It goes as far as what is learned and what is not learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Second, cognitive development is limited to a certain time span. Third and finally, Vygotsky claims that humans learn anything about anything because the process of learning itself is developed, rather than the object being learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) These principles combine together abstractly to form a general purpose of thought that is that society and culture impact cognitive development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Vygotsky believed that there is a form of filtering between cognitive thought and social occurrences that finally “integrates into the individuals thinking through the use of language”, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) which is a social process. This process, or what Vygotsky calls dialectical discovery, becomes more complex over time, which essentially states that “all higher functions originate as actual interpersonal relationships between individuals.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This higher function cognitive thinking, or very important types of learning, (Mcleod, 2008) comes through the interaction of a tutor. This tutor could “model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child”. (Mcleod, 2008) This is called cooperative or collaborative dialogue. (Mcleod, 2008) This cooperative thinking or collaborative thinking is further explained through the use of two concepts: the influence of the MKO, or “more knowledgeable other”, and the ZPD or the “zone of proximal development.” MKO was mentioned earlier and further conveyed with the concept of the tutor. However, the tutor does not always have to be a teacher or an older adult. Sometimes the MKO can be the peers, or it could simply be a machine that teaches the child. Regardless of the shape or form of the MKO, the MKO plays a role in the pouring of knowledge and cognitive development in the child. The ZPD or zone of proximal development is integrated into the MKO. That is, the ZPD explains an abstract or conceptual distance between what a child can learn on his or her own, the most inner circle, what the child can learn with help, or the middle circle, and the outer circle, which is what cannot be learned by the child currently, or beyond his or her reach. (Mcleod, 2008) What allows an individual to reach to the middle circle, or what can be learned with help, is through the use of scaffolding, (Mcleod, 2008) or the temporary support given to a child by a MKO, in order to “enable the child to perform a task until such time that child can already perform the task independently.” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Both Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories continue to be influential in the field of developmental psychology due to the numerous amount of research achieved by the above mentioned theorists, (Mcleod, 2012) contributing more clues in order to understand large challenges presented to developmental psychology and psychology in general, which in this case is, the question of how much nature vs. nurture, stability vs. change, and continuity vs. discontinuity impacts the development of a human being. (Mcleod, 2012) There is a difference between Vygotsky and Piaget’s view of development of children. Piaget first says that around from birth to two years of age a stage of cognitive development exists. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) So too, loosely, does Vygotsky. (Blunden, 2011) However, instead of the age being from birth to two for the first stage and from two to six for the second stage, Vygotsky claims that there is no stage for models of cognitive development but that instead there are periods of stable development mark with periods of crisis at the ages of 1, 3, 7, 13, and 17. (Blunden, 2011) Furthermore, Vygotsky is more focused on the learning processes of the child whereas Piaget’s theory focuses more on the development of the child. (Mcleod, 2007) And while Vygotsky’s perspective applies to all types of learners, Piaget’s theory focuses only on children. (Mcleod, 2007) So in regards to the sensorimotor stage, Piaget viewed that the child learned to navigate the world through the use of motor reflexes and physical sensation. (Mcleod, 2007) Object Permanence is gradually obtained. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, a period of crisis occurs at birth, twelve months, age three, seven, and thirteen. For Vygotsky a driving force of development through these crises is the result of “a gap between the child’s manifest needs and the current social means of their satisfaction.” (Blunden, 2011) For Piaget, the sensorimotor stage from birth to two, and the preoperational stage from two to seven, and the last two stages of his theory of cognitive development, graduation between these stages is not explained, only assumed. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, children develop through a crisis in which then help is supplemented to the child by a MKO or through scaffolding. (Blunden, 2011) Thus through these crises Vygotsky creates a form of description of age levels for children. (Blunden, 2011) And actually this chart is marked by the use of cognitive ability and a heavier emphasis of language through the help of other people on the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Where Piaget makes an assumption based on his research that object permanence is a concept that is sooner or later obtained in the sensorimotor stage, Vygotsky makes no claim whatsoever to the concept of object permanence. And while Piaget had created a model of stages of development based on age, Vygotsky rather makes no model for development and seems to imply the development is a continuous process. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget’s preoperational stage of development, from year two to seven, describes object constancy – Vygotsky says nothing of object constancy. (Cherry, 2006) While Piaget makes reference to the use of language becoming preeminent in the toddler, Vygotsky makes a heavy emphasis on language throughout all parts of the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget takes a heavier emphasis on the peer-to-peer interactions as the motor to social perspective taking, whereas Vygotsky claims that it is instead that the role of the adult that equips a child with intellectual adaption via cultural tools that children internalize. (Mcleod, 2008) The biggest difference between Piaget and Vygotsky in the role of cognitive development is that Vygotsky places large emphasis if not all emphasis on the role of societal influences on the developing child whereas the Piaget theory states that it is instead the role of a child’s independent exploration and construction of their own world that influences cognitive development. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky saw that language development occurred separately from thought and that they merge at around age three, thereby producing what Vygotsky called verbal thought, or inner speech. (Mcleod, 2008) Piaget theorized instead that thought preceded language and that language depended on thought for development. (Mcleod, 2008) Whereas for Piaget the sensorimotor and preoperational stages of cognitive development are universal, i.e. object permanence and object constancy occur at the same levels of development though at varying rates, Vygotsky would have rejected the theory in the view that instead the cognitive development of a child and of such concepts as object permanency and constancy are rather instead dependent upon societal and cultural factors. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally, all learning, social, cognitive, and language learning would have been, according to Piaget, must first develop in the theoretical stages of cognitive development, whereas Vygotsky would have claimed that “learning is a necessary and universal aspect of the process of developing culturally organized, specifically human psychological function.” (Mcleod, 2008) Because of the numerous factors involved in the development of a child, perhaps an exponential if not infinite amount of variables involved in this process, it may be best to view the various theories of developmental psychology as a framework of understanding in order to guide a researcher to more deeper understanding of the science of developmental psychology instead of a sort of myopia about Vygotsky or Piaget, incorrectly believing that one theorist holds the ultimate and final answer to the understanding of the development of humans. Perhaps both theorists would agree that the answer lies not in one or the other but a close immersion of both the theories and other future developmental theories to come. As much as we would like a key to life or various keys to life, it is usually a mixture of topics and understandings that bring us closer to the grander, more beautiful whole understanding of what the truth is. And the writer views this perspective as a good start. References Blunden, A. (2011). Vygotsky’s Theory of Child Development. Cherry, K. (2006, February 13).

(Cherry, 2006) That is, that constancy having to do with the ability to understand that different sizes relating to volume and mass do not have so much to do with shape. For example, when a glass of water of equal volume is poured into two cups, the infant tends to choose the taller cup believing that the taller cup holds more liquid though the volumes of both the short and tall cup are the same. Egocentrism begins to disappear. (Cherry, 2006) Though logic is becoming more developed, abstract and hypothetical concepts are still struggled with. (Cherry, 2006) Furthermore, a child begins to understand that the thoughts he or she holds can be unique to him or her and that those same thoughts are not always shared with by others. (Cherry, 2006) Finally, the fourth stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development is the formal operational stage, which lasts from 12 and throughout adulthood. At this stage young children and young adults are beginning to “think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.” (Cherry, 2006) The ability to “see multiple potential situations” is developed. Sometimes a type of egocentric thinking reoccurs. (Think of the moody, “Woe is me” teenager stage.) Intelligence is shown through the use of “logical symbols related to abstract concepts.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This stage is not always achieved – it was shown in later experiments. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Researchers Eylon and Linn categorized high school students according to Piaget’s developmental model and found that “most students have not attained formal operations stage by the time they get out of high school, let alone at age fifteen when Piaget states that most young people should have attained it.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Furthermore, Piaget stressed the importance of the difference between qualitative information and quantitative information related to these stages of development. That is, that information is not quantitative, or that information is not constantly being added to a child, but rather than the information is qualitative, or that the information simply becomes higher quality. (Cherry, 2006) Lev Semenovich Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that lived through the Russian Revolution. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Though the final work of Vygotsky did not reach full, worldwide recognition until around 1962 when his work was fully published, (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) his work was recognized, renowned, and influential in what now called Social Development Theory. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky’s theory holds that “no single principle can account for development.” (Mcleod, 2008) Furthermore, individual development “cannot be understood without reference to the social and cultural context within which it is embedded.” (Mcleod, 2008) Even higher metal processes are caused as a result of social processes. (Mcleod, 2008) So it is the social interaction with what is defined by Vygotsky as “More Knowledgeable Other”, or “MKO” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) that cognitive development is advanced in children. To quote Vygotsky in his own words, “the development of the mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Shortly put, according to Vygotsky, social interaction is the backbone, or framework, “for all learning and development”. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work can be divided into three major parts or principles. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The first principle is that social interaction progresses cognitive development. It is critical. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It goes as far as what is learned and what is not learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Second, cognitive development is limited to a certain time span. Third and finally, Vygotsky claims that humans learn anything about anything because the process of learning itself is developed, rather than the object being learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) These principles combine together abstractly to form a general purpose of thought that is that society and culture impact cognitive development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Vygotsky believed that there is a form of filtering between cognitive thought and social occurrences that finally “integrates into the individuals thinking through the use of language”, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) which is a social process. This process, or what Vygotsky calls dialectical discovery, becomes more complex over time, which essentially states that “all higher functions originate as actual interpersonal relationships between individuals.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This higher function cognitive thinking, or very important types of learning, (Mcleod, 2008) comes through the interaction of a tutor. This tutor could “model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child”. (Mcleod, 2008) This is called cooperative or collaborative dialogue. (Mcleod, 2008) This cooperative thinking or collaborative thinking is further explained through the use of two concepts: the influence of the MKO, or “more knowledgeable other”, and the ZPD or the “zone of proximal development.” MKO was mentioned earlier and further conveyed with the concept of the tutor. However, the tutor does not always have to be a teacher or an older adult. Sometimes the MKO can be the peers, or it could simply be a machine that teaches the child. Regardless of the shape or form of the MKO, the MKO plays a role in the pouring of knowledge and cognitive development in the child. The ZPD or zone of proximal development is integrated into the MKO. That is, the ZPD explains an abstract or conceptual distance between what a child can learn on his or her own, the most inner circle, what the child can learn with help, or the middle circle, and the outer circle, which is what cannot be learned by the child currently, or beyond his or her reach. (Mcleod, 2008) What allows an individual to reach to the middle circle, or what can be learned with help, is through the use of scaffolding, (Mcleod, 2008) or the temporary support given to a child by a MKO, in order to “enable the child to perform a task until such time that child can already perform the task independently.” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Both Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories continue to be influential in the field of developmental psychology due to the numerous amount of research achieved by the above mentioned theorists, (Mcleod, 2012) contributing more clues in order to understand large challenges presented to developmental psychology and psychology in general, which in this case is, the question of how much nature vs. nurture, stability vs. change, and continuity vs. discontinuity impacts the development of a human being. (Mcleod, 2012) There is a difference between Vygotsky and Piaget’s view of development of children. Piaget first says that around from birth to two years of age a stage of cognitive development exists. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) So too, loosely, does Vygotsky. (Blunden, 2011) However, instead of the age being from birth to two for the first stage and from two to six for the second stage, Vygotsky claims that there is no stage for models of cognitive development but that instead there are periods of stable development mark with periods of crisis at the ages of 1, 3, 7, 13, and 17. (Blunden, 2011) Furthermore, Vygotsky is more focused on the learning processes of the child whereas Piaget’s theory focuses more on the development of the child. (Mcleod, 2007) And while Vygotsky’s perspective applies to all types of learners, Piaget’s theory focuses only on children. (Mcleod, 2007) So in regards to the sensorimotor stage, Piaget viewed that the child learned to navigate the world through the use of motor reflexes and physical sensation. (Mcleod, 2007) Object Permanence is gradually obtained. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, a period of crisis occurs at birth, twelve months, age three, seven, and thirteen. For Vygotsky a driving force of development through these crises is the result of “a gap between the child’s manifest needs and the current social means of their satisfaction.” (Blunden, 2011) For Piaget, the sensorimotor stage from birth to two, and the preoperational stage from two to seven, and the last two stages of his theory of cognitive development, graduation between these stages is not explained, only assumed. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, children develop through a crisis in which then help is supplemented to the child by a MKO or through scaffolding. (Blunden, 2011) Thus through these crises Vygotsky creates a form of description of age levels for children. (Blunden, 2011) And actually this chart is marked by the use of cognitive ability and a heavier emphasis of language through the help of other people on the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Where Piaget makes an assumption based on his research that object permanence is a concept that is sooner or later obtained in the sensorimotor stage, Vygotsky makes no claim whatsoever to the concept of object permanence. And while Piaget had created a model of stages of development based on age, Vygotsky rather makes no model for development and seems to imply the development is a continuous process. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget’s preoperational stage of development, from year two to seven, describes object constancy – Vygotsky says nothing of object constancy. (Cherry, 2006) While Piaget makes reference to the use of language becoming preeminent in the toddler, Vygotsky makes a heavy emphasis on language throughout all parts of the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget takes a heavier emphasis on the peer-to-peer interactions as the motor to social perspective taking, whereas Vygotsky claims that it is instead that the role of the adult that equips a child with intellectual adaption via cultural tools that children internalize. (Mcleod, 2008) The biggest difference between Piaget and Vygotsky in the role of cognitive development is that Vygotsky places large emphasis if not all emphasis on the role of societal influences on the developing child whereas the Piaget theory states that it is instead the role of a child’s independent exploration and construction of their own world that influences cognitive development. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky saw that language development occurred separately from thought and that they merge at around age three, thereby producing what Vygotsky called verbal thought, or inner speech. (Mcleod, 2008) Piaget theorized instead that thought preceded language and that language depended on thought for development. (Mcleod, 2008) Whereas for Piaget the sensorimotor and preoperational stages of cognitive development are universal, i.e. object permanence and object constancy occur at the same levels of development though at varying rates, Vygotsky would have rejected the theory in the view that instead the cognitive development of a child and of such concepts as object permanency and constancy are rather instead dependent upon societal and cultural factors. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally, all learning, social, cognitive, and language learning would have been, according to Piaget, must first develop in the theoretical stages of cognitive development, whereas Vygotsky would have claimed that “learning is a necessary and universal aspect of the process of developing culturally organized, specifically human psychological function.” (Mcleod, 2008) Because of the numerous factors involved in the development of a child, perhaps an exponential if not infinite amount of variables involved in this process, it may be best to view the various theories of developmental psychology as a framework of understanding in order to guide a researcher to more deeper understanding of the science of developmental psychology instead of a sort of myopia about Vygotsky or Piaget, incorrectly believing that one theorist holds the ultimate and final answer to the understanding of the development of humans. Perhaps both theorists would agree that the answer lies not in one or the other but a close immersion of both the theories and other future developmental theories to come. As much as we would like a key to life or various keys to life, it is usually a mixture of topics and understandings that bring us closer to the grander, more beautiful whole understanding of what the truth is. And the writer views this perspective as a good start. References Blunden, A. (2011). Vygotsky’s Theory of Child Development. Cherry, K. (2006, February 13).

{"@type":"BlogPosting","description":"“Developmental psychology is a scientific approach which aims to explain growth, change, and consistency through the lifespan. Developmental psychology looks at how thinking, feeling, and behavior change throughout a person’s life.” (Mcleod, 2012) This theory of developmental psychology mostly builds on theories related to a person’s childhood, as “this is the period during an individual’s lifespan when the most change occurs.” (Mcleod, 2012) The theories developed by researchers like Vygotsky, Piaget, and many others point to the fundamental purpose of the theories of developmental psychology – that is, the relationship of people and environment and that “humans seek meaningful interactions with the environment and construct knowledge of themselves and the world around them through these interactions.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) And since mentioned previously that the majority of theories of developmental psychology focus on the importance of childhood and the many changes that occur during this period, (Mcleod, 2012) it is important to understand another factor related to developmental psychology – that children grow up to be adults that function in a society and sharing that society with other human beings. In any and every society a variety of influences affect a human being in his or her outlook of the world, not to mention an exponential amount of influences related to genetics and biology that also affect a human being’s development. According to developmental psychology, this is known as the environment, or nature. And so developmental psychology seeks to explain how much of an impact environment, or nature, has in the role of the development of a human being. Perhaps human beings teach and raise children because of an innate need to express a lineage and a form of continuity of thought. Developmental psychology also seeks to explain how much of an impact human beings have upon others. Because there is a wide margin of differences between human beings and at the same time a form of consistency in the development of human beings, developmental psychology arose as a need to explain the impact of these factors and its relationships with human beings. Specifically, this exposition of developmental psychology will too follow in the focus of the broader perspective and theories of developmental psychology – it will focus on childhood and the development thereof, and specifically two theories which explain the development of childhood between the first two years of life, the years of life between two and six, and the analyzing of the effects of cognitive, language, and social development of a child with the explanation of the two theories. Those two theories are the theories proposed by Vygotsky and Piaget. Piaget was born in Switzerland. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Not only was he involved in the developmental psychology realm as a behavioral psychologist, he also was a biologist, and a philosopher. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It was in the 1960’s and 1970’s that his theories became widely accepted. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) A self-described genetic epistemologist, he focused his work on how biology and the formation of how children think and act played a role on each other. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This was his desire that he formed a general theory of such development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work cannot be overstated. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His theories were a profound change of the pattern of thought at the time, which viewed that children are just smaller versions of adults. (Cherry, 2006) And though he likely lived through the influence and impact of Freudian and Jungian psychology, Piaget took a different approach to the perspective of the development of children. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, not all of his theories rejected Freudian psychology – (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) specifically that the development of children could be explained in a series of stages. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, Piaget differs from Freudian psychology in that the repression of sexuality in the development of a human being is largely ignored and instead Piaget proposes that children are active learners engaged in the adding and modifying of cognitive structures, which are, according to Piaget, known as schemas. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) His second theory is the development of a model of cognitive developmental stages. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Schemas are the “mental and physical actions involved in understanding and knowing.” (Cherry, 2006) Inside this schema are two further concepts: the category of knowledge and the process of obtaining that knowledge. (Cherry, 2006) These two concepts can be summarized as the process of adaption. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Specifically, adaptation is “predicated on the belief that the building of knowledge is a continuous activity of self-construction; as a person interacts with the new environment, knowledge is invented and manipulated into cognitive structures.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) When a “discrepancy” is found in the environment, a human being, according to Piaget, resorts to one of two facilities: assimilation or accommodation. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Assimilation is the process by which the perception of the environment is changed to fit the mold of a previously existing schema, or structure of understanding of cognitive thought by which a person navigates the world. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The second facility is known as accommodation, which is that the actual schema, or the previously mentioned structure of cognitive thought, is changed or modified to fit a new way of understanding the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Whatever way is chosen, the path is chosen by way of interaction with the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This decision occurs as a result of a desire to reach a harmony of understanding between the environment and the existing mental schema, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) or the “force which moves development along.” (Mcleod, 2007) This process of equilibrium is not a progressive state that develops in a linear fashion. (Mcleod, 2007) Instead, this process moves in “leaps and bounds.” (Mcleod, 2007) To further explain equilibrium an example can be given. A human being experiences disequilibrium, or an unpleasant state of being, when an existing mental schema does not match with the environment that was experienced by the human. (Mcleod, 2007) This learning process, equilibrium, or the desire to depart of an unpleasant state of existence, drives along learning because human beings “do not like to be frustrated” and “will seek to restore balance by mastering the new challenge (accommodation). (Mcleod, 2007) Once the equilibrium is achieved again through the process of assimilation into the new mental schema, or through the process of accommodation, the new schema continues until change is required. (Mcleod, 2007) The second portion of Piaget’s theory of development has to do with his model of cognitive development. There are four pieces of cognitive development according to Piaget: the sensorimotor stage, the pre-operational stage, the concrete stage, and the formal operational stage. (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, every child goes through these four stages in the same order. (Mcleod, 2007) Differences in the development relates to “biological maturation and interaction with the environment.” (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, though no stages can be left out, there are differences in the timing, or rate of the succession of the model, some individuals never graduate past a certain level, particularly the latter stages. (Mcleod, 2007) In all four of these stages, according to Piaget, there are three types of knowledge that are present. They are, physical, logical-mathematical, and social. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) All three of these types of knowledge are gained from interaction with the environment. This means that these non-hierarchical processes are at work in all four of the hierarchical stages of development in Piaget’s model. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The sensorimotor stage lasts from birth to age two. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The use of symbols is not involved in the process by which the infant navigates the world. Instead, the infant depends on physical and motor activity. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This is the main form of interaction for the infant. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Around the period of seven months, an infant may begin to understand the concept of object permanence, which is that objects can exist even if they are not physically seen. This requires the ability to understand abstract concepts. The second stage is the preoperational stage. This begins at around age two and ends around age seven. Symbolic thinking is becoming to be unlocked and the toddler now understands that symbols, words or pictures can be used to represent objects. (Cherry, 2006) Toddlers are still egocentric and struggle to take the view of others. (Cherry, 2006) This can be witnessed through the one way style of communication that toddlers express, or a lack of exchange of information. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Language use is becoming more prevalent. Pretend play can be witnessed since the use of imagination and memory has been a developing feature. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Although logic is slowly forming, a child’s ability to handle logic is mostly “monological”, or that they can only understand one aspect of a logical problem at a time. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The third stage is the concrete operational stage which lasts from around seven to eleven years. The concept of constancy, which the toddler had previously struggled with in the preoperational stage, is now fully developed in the concrete operational stage. (Cherry, 2006) That is, that constancy having to do with the ability to understand that different sizes relating to volume and mass do not have so much to do with shape. For example, when a glass of water of equal volume is poured into two cups, the infant tends to choose the taller cup believing that the taller cup holds more liquid though the volumes of both the short and tall cup are the same. Egocentrism begins to disappear. (Cherry, 2006) Though logic is becoming more developed, abstract and hypothetical concepts are still struggled with. (Cherry, 2006) Furthermore, a child begins to understand that the thoughts he or she holds can be unique to him or her and that those same thoughts are not always shared with by others. (Cherry, 2006) Finally, the fourth stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development is the formal operational stage, which lasts from 12 and throughout adulthood. At this stage young children and young adults are beginning to “think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.” (Cherry, 2006) The ability to “see multiple potential situations” is developed. Sometimes a type of egocentric thinking reoccurs. (Think of the moody, “Woe is me” teenager stage.) Intelligence is shown through the use of “logical symbols related to abstract concepts.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This stage is not always achieved – it was shown in later experiments. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Researchers Eylon and Linn categorized high school students according to Piaget’s developmental model and found that “most students have not attained formal operations stage by the time they get out of high school, let alone at age fifteen when Piaget states that most young people should have attained it.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Furthermore, Piaget stressed the importance of the difference between qualitative information and quantitative information related to these stages of development. That is, that information is not quantitative, or that information is not constantly being added to a child, but rather than the information is qualitative, or that the information simply becomes higher quality. (Cherry, 2006) Lev Semenovich Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that lived through the Russian Revolution.

To quote Vygotsky in his own words, “the development of the mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Shortly put, according to Vygotsky, social interaction is the backbone, or framework, “for all learning and development”. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work can be divided into three major parts or principles. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The first principle is that social interaction progresses cognitive development.

This process, or what Vygotsky calls dialectical discovery, becomes more complex over time, which essentially states that “all higher functions originate as actual interpersonal relationships between individuals.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This higher function cognitive thinking, or very important types of learning, (Mcleod, 2008) comes through the interaction of a tutor. This tutor could “model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child”. (Mcleod, 2008) This is called cooperative or collaborative dialogue. (Mcleod, 2008) This cooperative thinking or collaborative thinking is further explained through the use of two concepts: the influence of the MKO, or “more knowledgeable other”, and the ZPD or the “zone of proximal development.” MKO was mentioned earlier and further conveyed with the concept of the tutor. However, the tutor does not always have to be a teacher or an older adult. Sometimes the MKO can be the peers, or it could simply be a machine that teaches the child. Regardless of the shape or form of the MKO, the MKO plays a role in the pouring of knowledge and cognitive development in the child. The ZPD or zone of proximal development is integrated into the MKO. That is, the ZPD explains an abstract or conceptual distance between what a child can learn on his or her own, the most inner circle, what the child can learn with help, or the middle circle, and the outer circle, which is what cannot be learned by the child currently, or beyond his or her reach. (Mcleod, 2008) What allows an individual to reach to the middle circle, or what can be learned with help, is through the use of scaffolding, (Mcleod, 2008) or the temporary support given to a child by a MKO, in order to “enable the child to perform a task until such time that child can already perform the task independently.” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Both Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories continue to be influential in the field of developmental psychology due to the numerous amount of research achieved by the above mentioned theorists, (Mcleod, 2012) contributing more clues in order to understand large challenges presented to developmental psychology and psychology in general, which in this case is, the question of how much nature vs. nurture, stability vs. change, and continuity vs. discontinuity impacts the development of a human being. (Mcleod, 2012) There is a difference between Vygotsky and Piaget’s view of development of children.

(Cherry, 2006) While Piaget makes reference to the use of language becoming preeminent in the toddler, Vygotsky makes a heavy emphasis on language throughout all parts of the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget takes a heavier emphasis on the peer-to-peer interactions as the motor to social perspective taking, whereas Vygotsky claims that it is instead that the role of the adult that equips a child with intellectual adaption via cultural tools that children internalize. (Mcleod, 2008) The biggest difference between Piaget and Vygotsky in the role of cognitive development is that Vygotsky places large emphasis if not all emphasis on the role of societal influences on the developing child whereas the Piaget theory states that it is instead the role of a child’s independent exploration and construction of their own world that influences cognitive development. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky saw that language development occurred separately from thought and that they merge at around age three, thereby producing what Vygotsky called verbal thought, or inner speech. (Mcleod, 2008) Piaget theorized instead that thought preceded language and that language depended on thought for development. (Mcleod, 2008) Whereas for Piaget the sensorimotor and preoperational stages of cognitive development are universal, i.e. object permanence and object constancy occur at the same levels of development though at varying rates, Vygotsky would have rejected the theory in the view that instead the cognitive development of a child and of such concepts as object permanency and constancy are rather instead dependent upon societal and cultural factors. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally, all learning, social, cognitive, and language learning would have been, according to Piaget, must first develop in the theoretical stages of cognitive development, whereas Vygotsky would have claimed that “learning is a necessary and universal aspect of the process of developing culturally organized, specifically human psychological function.” (Mcleod, 2008) Because of the numerous factors involved in the development of a child, perhaps an exponential if not infinite amount of variables involved in this process, it may be best to view the various theories of developmental psychology as a framework of understanding in order to guide a researcher to more deeper understanding of the science of developmental psychology instead of a sort of myopia about Vygotsky or Piaget, incorrectly believing that one theorist holds the ultimate and final answer to the understanding of the development of humans. Perhaps both theorists would agree that the answer lies not in one or the other but a close immersion of both the theories and other future developmental theories to come. As much as we would like a key to life or various keys to life, it is usually a mixture of topics and understandings that bring us closer to the grander, more beautiful whole understanding of what the truth is. And the writer views this perspective as a good start. References Blunden, A. (2011). Vygotsky’s Theory of Child Development. Cherry, K. (2006, February 13).

  <p>“Developmental psychology is a scientific approach which aims to explain growth, change, and consistency through the lifespan. Developmental psychology looks at how thinking, feeling, and behavior change throughout a person’s life.” (Mcleod, 2012) This theory of developmental psychology mostly builds on theories related to a person’s childhood, as “this is the period during an individual’s lifespan when the most change occurs.” (Mcleod, 2012) The theories developed by researchers like Vygotsky, Piaget, and many others point to the fundamental purpose of the theories of developmental psychology – that is, the relationship of people and environment and that “humans seek meaningful interactions with the environment and construct knowledge of themselves and the world around them through these interactions.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) And since mentioned previously that the majority of theories of developmental psychology focus on the importance of childhood and the many changes that occur during this period, (Mcleod, 2012) it is important to understand another factor related to developmental psychology – that children grow up to be adults that function in a society and sharing that society with other human beings.<br />
In any and every society a variety of influences affect a human being in his or her outlook of the world, not to mention an exponential amount of influences related to genetics and biology that also affect a human being’s development. According to developmental psychology, this is known as the environment, or nature. And so developmental psychology seeks to explain how much of an impact environment, or nature, has in the role of the development of a human being. Perhaps human beings teach and raise children because of an innate need to express a lineage and a form of continuity of thought. Developmental psychology also seeks to explain how much of an impact human beings have upon others. Because there is a wide margin of differences between human beings and at the same time a form of consistency in the development of human beings, developmental psychology arose as a need to explain the impact of these factors and its relationships with human beings.<br />
Specifically, this exposition of developmental psychology will too follow in the focus of the broader perspective and theories of developmental psychology – it will focus on childhood and the development thereof, and specifically two theories which explain the development of childhood between the first two years of life, the years of life between two and six, and the analyzing of the effects of cognitive, language, and social development of a child with the explanation of the two theories. Those two theories are the theories proposed by Vygotsky and Piaget.<br />
Piaget was born in Switzerland. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Not only was he involved in the developmental psychology realm as a behavioral psychologist, he also was a biologist, and a philosopher. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It was in the 1960’s and 1970’s that his theories became widely accepted. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) A self-described genetic epistemologist, he focused his work on how biology and the formation of how children think and act played a role on each other. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This was his desire that he formed a general theory of such development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His work cannot be overstated. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) His theories were a profound change of the pattern of thought at the time, which viewed that children are just smaller versions of adults. (Cherry, 2006) And though he likely lived through the influence and impact of Freudian and Jungian psychology, Piaget took a different approach to the perspective of the development of children. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, not all of his theories rejected Freudian psychology – (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) specifically that the development of children could be explained in a series of stages. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, Piaget differs from Freudian psychology in that the repression of sexuality in the development of a human being is largely ignored and instead Piaget proposes that children are active learners engaged in the adding and modifying of cognitive structures, which are, according to Piaget, known as schemas. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) His second theory is the development of a model of cognitive developmental stages. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004)<br />
Schemas are the “mental and physical actions involved in understanding and knowing.” (Cherry, 2006) Inside this schema are two further concepts: the category of knowledge and the process of obtaining that knowledge. (Cherry, 2006) These two concepts can be summarized as the process of adaption. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Specifically, adaptation is “predicated on the belief that the building of knowledge is a continuous activity of self-construction; as a person interacts with the new environment, knowledge is invented and manipulated into cognitive structures.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) When a “discrepancy” is found in the environment, a human being, according to Piaget, resorts to one of two facilities: assimilation or accommodation. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Assimilation is the process by which the perception of the environment is changed to fit the mold of a previously existing schema, or structure of understanding of cognitive thought by which a person navigates the world. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The second facility is known as accommodation, which is that the actual schema, or the previously mentioned structure of cognitive thought, is changed or modified to fit a new way of understanding the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Whatever way is chosen, the path is chosen by way of interaction with the environment. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This decision occurs as a result of a desire to reach a harmony of understanding between the environment and the existing mental schema, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) or the “force which moves development along.” (Mcleod, 2007) This process of equilibrium is not a progressive state that develops in a linear fashion. (Mcleod, 2007) Instead, this process moves in “leaps and bounds.” (Mcleod, 2007) To further explain equilibrium an example can be given. A human being experiences disequilibrium, or an unpleasant state of being, when an existing mental schema does not match with the environment that was experienced by the human. (Mcleod, 2007) This learning process, equilibrium, or the desire to depart of an unpleasant state of existence, drives along learning because human beings “do not like to be frustrated” and “will seek to restore balance by mastering the new challenge (accommodation). (Mcleod, 2007) Once the equilibrium is achieved again through the process of assimilation into the new mental schema, or through the process of accommodation, the new schema continues until change is required. (Mcleod, 2007)<br />
The second portion of Piaget’s theory of development has to do with his model of cognitive development. There are four pieces of cognitive development according to Piaget: the sensorimotor stage, the pre-operational stage, the concrete stage, and the formal operational stage. (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, every child goes through these four stages in the same order. (Mcleod, 2007) Differences in the development relates to “biological maturation and interaction with the environment.” (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, though no stages can be left out, there are differences in the timing, or rate of the succession of the model, some individuals never graduate past a certain level, particularly the latter stages. (Mcleod, 2007) In all four of these stages, according to Piaget, there are three types of knowledge that are present. They are, physical, logical-mathematical, and social. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) All three of these types of knowledge are gained from interaction with the environment. This means that these non-hierarchical processes are at work in all four of the hierarchical stages of development in Piaget’s model. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004)<br />
The sensorimotor stage lasts from birth to age two. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The use of symbols is not involved in the process by which the infant navigates the world. Instead, the infant depends on physical and motor activity. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This is the main form of interaction for the infant. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Around the period of seven months, an infant may begin to understand the concept of object permanence, which is that objects can exist even if they are not physically seen. This requires the ability to understand abstract concepts. The second stage is the preoperational stage. This begins at around age two and ends around age seven. Symbolic thinking is becoming to be unlocked and the toddler now understands that symbols, words or pictures can be used to represent objects. (Cherry, 2006) Toddlers are still egocentric and struggle to take the view of others. (Cherry, 2006) This can be witnessed through the one way style of communication that toddlers express, or a lack of exchange of information. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Language use is becoming more prevalent. Pretend play can be witnessed since the use of imagination and memory has been a developing feature. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Although logic is slowly forming, a child’s ability to handle logic is mostly “monological”, or that they can only understand one aspect of a logical problem at a time. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The third stage is the concrete operational stage which lasts from around seven to eleven years. The concept of constancy, which the toddler had previously struggled with in the preoperational stage, is now fully developed in the concrete operational stage. (Cherry, 2006) That is, that constancy having to do with the ability to understand that different sizes relating to volume and mass do not have so much to do with shape. For example, when a glass of water of equal volume is poured into two cups, the infant tends to choose the taller cup believing that the taller cup holds more liquid though the volumes of both the short and tall cup are the same. Egocentrism begins to disappear. (Cherry, 2006) Though logic is becoming more developed, abstract and hypothetical concepts are still struggled with. (Cherry, 2006) Furthermore, a child begins to understand that the thoughts he or she holds can be unique to him or her and that those same thoughts are not always shared with by others. (Cherry, 2006) Finally, the fourth stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development is the formal operational stage, which lasts from 12 and throughout adulthood. At this stage young children and young adults are beginning to “think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.” (Cherry, 2006) The ability to “see multiple potential situations” is developed. Sometimes a type of egocentric thinking reoccurs. (Think of the moody, “Woe is me” teenager stage.) Intelligence is shown through the use of “logical symbols related to abstract concepts.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This stage is not always achieved – it was shown in later experiments. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Researchers Eylon and Linn categorized high school students according to Piaget’s developmental model and found that “most students have not attained formal operations stage by the time they get out of high school, let alone at age fifteen when Piaget states that most young people should have attained it.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Furthermore, Piaget stressed the importance of the difference between qualitative information and quantitative information related to these stages of development. That is, that information is not quantitative, or that information is not constantly being added to a child, but rather than the information is qualitative, or that the information simply becomes higher quality. (Cherry, 2006)<br />
Lev Semenovich Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that lived through the Russian Revolution. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Though the final work of Vygotsky did not reach full, worldwide recognition until around 1962 when his work was fully published, (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) his work was recognized, renowned, and influential in what now called Social Development Theory. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky’s theory holds that “no single principle can account for development.” (Mcleod, 2008) Furthermore, individual development “cannot be understood without reference to the social and cultural context within which it is embedded.” (Mcleod, 2008) Even higher metal processes are caused as a result of social processes. (Mcleod, 2008) So it is the social interaction with what is defined by Vygotsky as “More Knowledgeable Other”, or “MKO” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) that cognitive development is advanced in children. To quote Vygotsky in his own words, “the development of the mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Shortly put, according to Vygotsky, social interaction is the backbone, or framework, “for all learning and development”. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004)<br />
His work can be divided into three major parts or principles. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) The first principle is that social interaction progresses cognitive development. It is critical. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) It goes as far as what is learned and what is not learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Second, cognitive development is limited to a certain time span. Third and finally, Vygotsky claims that humans learn anything about anything because the process of learning itself is developed, rather than the object being learned. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) These principles combine together abstractly to form a general purpose of thought that is that society and culture impact cognitive development. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) Vygotsky believed that there is a form of filtering between cognitive thought and social occurrences that finally “integrates into the individuals thinking through the use of language”, (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) which is a social process. This process, or what Vygotsky calls dialectical discovery, becomes more complex over time, which essentially states that “all higher functions originate as actual interpersonal relationships between individuals.” (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) This higher function cognitive thinking, or very important types of learning, (Mcleod, 2008) comes through the interaction of a tutor. This tutor could “model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child”. (Mcleod, 2008) This is called cooperative or collaborative dialogue. (Mcleod, 2008) This cooperative thinking or collaborative thinking is further explained through the use of two concepts: the influence of the MKO, or “more knowledgeable other”, and the ZPD or the “zone of proximal development.” MKO was mentioned earlier and further conveyed with the concept of the tutor. However, the tutor does not always have to be a teacher or an older adult. Sometimes the MKO can be the peers, or it could simply be a machine that teaches the child. Regardless of the shape or form of the MKO, the MKO plays a role in the pouring of knowledge and cognitive development in the child. The ZPD or zone of proximal development is integrated into the MKO. That is, the ZPD explains an abstract or conceptual distance between what a child can learn on his or her own, the most inner circle, what the child can learn with help, or the middle circle, and the outer circle, which is what cannot be learned by the child currently, or beyond his or her reach. (Mcleod, 2008) What allows an individual to reach to the middle circle, or what can be learned with help, is through the use of scaffolding, (Mcleod, 2008) or the temporary support given to a child by a MKO, in order to “enable the child to perform a task until such time that child can already perform the task independently.” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Both Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories continue to be influential in the field of developmental psychology due to the numerous amount of research achieved by the above mentioned theorists, (Mcleod, 2012) contributing more clues in order to understand large challenges presented to developmental psychology and psychology in general, which in this case is, the question of how much nature vs. nurture, stability vs. change, and continuity vs. discontinuity impacts the development of a human being. (Mcleod, 2012)<br />
There is a difference between Vygotsky and Piaget’s view of development of children. Piaget first says that around from birth to two years of age a stage of cognitive development exists. (Lutz &amp; Huitt, 2004) So too, loosely, does Vygotsky. (Blunden, 2011) However, instead of the age being from birth to two for the first stage and from two to six for the second stage, Vygotsky claims that there is no stage for models of cognitive development but that instead there are periods of stable development mark with periods of crisis at the ages of 1, 3, 7, 13, and 17. (Blunden, 2011) Furthermore, Vygotsky is more focused on the learning processes of the child whereas Piaget’s theory focuses more on the development of the child. (Mcleod, 2007) And while Vygotsky’s perspective applies to all types of learners, Piaget’s theory focuses only on children. (Mcleod, 2007) So in regards to the sensorimotor stage, Piaget viewed that the child learned to navigate the world through the use of motor reflexes and physical sensation. (Mcleod, 2007) Object Permanence is gradually obtained. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, a period of crisis occurs at birth, twelve months, age three, seven, and thirteen. For Vygotsky a driving force of development through these crises is the result of “a gap between the child’s manifest needs and the current social means of their satisfaction.” (Blunden, 2011) For Piaget, the sensorimotor stage from birth to two, and the preoperational stage from two to seven, and the last two stages of his theory of cognitive development, graduation between these stages is not explained, only assumed. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, children develop through a crisis in which then help is supplemented to the child by a MKO or through scaffolding. (Blunden, 2011) Thus through these crises Vygotsky creates a form of description of age levels for children. (Blunden, 2011) And actually this chart is marked by the use of cognitive ability and a heavier emphasis of language through the help of other people on the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Where Piaget makes an assumption based on his research that object permanence is a concept that is sooner or later obtained in the sensorimotor stage, Vygotsky makes no claim whatsoever to the concept of object permanence. And while Piaget had created a model of stages of development based on age, Vygotsky rather makes no model for development and seems to imply the development is a continuous process. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget’s preoperational stage of development, from year two to seven, describes object constancy – Vygotsky says nothing of object constancy. (Cherry, 2006) While Piaget makes reference to the use of language becoming preeminent in the toddler, Vygotsky makes a heavy emphasis on language throughout all parts of the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget takes a heavier emphasis on the peer-to-peer interactions as the motor to social perspective taking, whereas Vygotsky claims that it is instead that the role of the adult that equips a child with intellectual adaption via cultural tools that children internalize. (Mcleod, 2008) The biggest difference between Piaget and Vygotsky in the role of cognitive development is that Vygotsky places large emphasis if not all emphasis on the role of societal influences on the developing child whereas the Piaget theory states that it is instead the role of a child’s independent exploration and construction of their own world that influences cognitive development. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky saw that language development occurred separately from thought and that they merge at around age three, thereby producing what Vygotsky called verbal thought, or inner speech. (Mcleod, 2008) Piaget theorized instead that thought preceded language and that language depended on thought for development. (Mcleod, 2008) Whereas for Piaget the sensorimotor and preoperational stages of cognitive development are universal, i.e. object permanence and object constancy occur at the same levels of development though at varying rates, Vygotsky would have rejected the theory in the view that instead the cognitive development of a child and of such concepts as object permanency and constancy are rather instead dependent upon societal and cultural factors. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally, all learning, social, cognitive, and language learning would have been, according to Piaget, must first develop in the theoretical stages of cognitive development, whereas Vygotsky would have claimed that “learning is a necessary and universal aspect of the process of developing culturally organized, specifically human psychological function.” (Mcleod, 2008)<br />
Because of the numerous factors involved in the development of a child, perhaps an exponential if not infinite amount of variables involved in this process, it may be best to view the various theories of developmental psychology as a framework of understanding in order to guide a researcher to more deeper understanding of the science of developmental psychology instead of a sort of myopia about Vygotsky or Piaget, incorrectly believing that one theorist holds the ultimate and final answer to the understanding of the development of humans. Perhaps both theorists would agree that the answer lies not in one or the other but a close immersion of both the theories and other future developmental theories to come. As much as we would like a key to life or various keys to life, it is usually a mixture of topics and understandings that bring us closer to the grander, more beautiful whole understanding of what the truth is. And the writer views this perspective as a good start.</p>
