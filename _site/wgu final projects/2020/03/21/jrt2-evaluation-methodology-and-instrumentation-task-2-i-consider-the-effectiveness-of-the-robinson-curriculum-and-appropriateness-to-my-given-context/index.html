<p>A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College of<br />
Western Governors University</p>

<p>Product or Program Appropriateness<br />
The Robinson Curriculum is a homeschooling curriculum designed as an alternative to public schooling. This curriculum focuses on arithmetic, writing, and reading as a core curriculum for the learner. According to the Robinson Curriculum, it stands in contrast to public schooling because of its views of politics, sociology, philosophy, and religion. The view of public schooling, according to the Robinson Curriculum is that the quality of public schooling is very low, producing poorly performing students. Continuing, it holds that public schools are filled with indoctrinated views that prevent students from learning truths related to history and religion. (source)<br />
This program would be appropriate in my situation because hypothetically I will have children one day and I intend to homeschool my children. There is currently no other formal situation in which I would teach or am a teacher to my organization. Neither am I a teacher in a traditional classroom. This curriculum is also appropriate to my setting because I do not think sociological and political viewpoints should influence the learning of academic truth. Because I want to be able to quantify the results of the type of education in terms of the total cost I am investing in for my children, I do not have them attend a public school because American public schools as a whole perform last in most developed countries when it comes to student performance. Because I do not have the time nor enough resources to allow my children to be experiments for educators that I do not know to have an influence on my children, I choose a curriculum that allows me to view the material as well as being able to put my children through a faster and more challenging pace so that they can become competitive in the now increasingly global job market.<br />
Purpose and Participants<br />
For the sake of brevity, I will create an assessment of the Robinson Curriculum’s first math unit, which uses the Saxon Math 5/4 curriculum. Specifically, I will assess the first lesson plan of Saxon Math 5/4. I want to test to see if students are able to perform basic recall of mathematical ability upon the end of Saxon Math 5/4’s first lesson. Saxon Math’s philosophy is that it promotes learning through incremental progress and continual review. (source1) That is, topics of learning are discussed and spread out throughout the curriculum and only when the entirely of the topic is explained then does the curriculum move onto the next topic. Secondly, that continual review promotes long term learning of the mathematical concepts through the use of constant review. The person that will be receiving this assessment will be my imaginary child, since the assessment states that I do not have to give the evaluation, only that I create it. My child will be 9, male or female (it does not matter), Asian or mixed. It will be his or her first mathematical curriculum, but he or she will have been learning his or her addition and subtraction tables prior to this. He or she will not be uncomfortable with math, but it will be the first time that he or she will be learning on his or her own.<br />
Performance Objectives Justification<br />
My performance objectives are listed below in the three objectives formatted to Mager’s objectives. Early mathematics requires that a student be able to memorize the basic facts of addition and subtraction. Just as a student learns that the nucleus is the brain of a cell, so too much a student learn that two addends give us a sum. Furthermore, a student should be able to know that 7+8=15 without calculation. Finally, the commutative and identity properties of addition will be a concept that is built upon later in the student’s mathematics career. I want to list performance objectives relating to the student’s ability to perform basic mathematical problems and to show understanding of the identity and commutative properties of addition through successful performance of the addition problems.<br />
My child will be able to identify the addends and sum on the Saxon Math worksheet after reading through and performing the tasks in the Saxon Math 5/4 lesson 1. The ability to identify the addends and sums shall be no less than 95% accuracy. No time limits.<br />
My child will be able to complete the Saxon Math Lesson 1 worksheet after going through the first Saxon math lesson with no less than 95% accuracy. No time limits.<br />
My child will be able to look at two randomly thrown dice and create a number sentence from it after going through the first lesson. There will be 20 rolls. This too will be at a 95% accuracy or greater. No time limits.<br />
Assessment Validity<br />
I am looking for comprehension of the material learned and the ability to perform the tasks that Saxon math calls for. First, my assessment utilizes the Saxon Math worksheet to make my own assessment. The Saxon Math curriculum does not call for the student to make a certain percentage of accuracy before moving on to the next assessment. Second, I am utilizing the same worksheet and asking my child to identify the addends and the sum for each of the problems. Finally, to change things up, I am taking two dice and having my child roll them, write a number sentence from the results, and to give the sum of the two addends of the dice. Validity is the extent to which an assessment measures what it is intending to measure. For example, a geography assessment should include assessment involving geography, not mathematical problems. As you can see, my assessment has a degree of face validity. I am looking to assess mathematical comprehension. My assessment measures the ability to identify addends and sums, to be able to write addition number sentences, and to be able to compute basic addition facts. My assessment is shown in appendix A.<br />
Assessment Justification<br />
Basic ability to compute addition facts such as 9+1 does not necessarily indicate cognitive ability. Furthermore, the addition facts that are explained in lesson one is simply memorization. To say that 9+1 requires computation would be a stretch for students beginning the Saxon Math 5/4 curriculum. This is why I am looking for performance objectives. I want to be able to measure my child’s ability to perform math rather than seeking to measure cognitive ability. I do not intend to use a multiple-choice exam to assess this mathematical ability because I am not ready to introduce my child to competitive test taking environments yet. I do not use a project because it would be too time consuming and because Saxon Math utilizes the drilling of math problems, I am limited on the amount of extra-curricular activities that I can utilize for my child, even if it is for a summative evaluation. Formative evaluation is conducted for the facilitating of the learning of the student. I am not conducting a formative evaluation. I am conducting a summative evaluation because I am attempting to judge the merit of the Saxon math curriculum – will I continue to use this curriculum or will I move to a different curriculum? Summative evaluation is conducted for this purpose, among others. But the biggest factor of the summative evaluation process is to know whether or not the curriculum or instruction as a whole benefit the stakeholders enough to justify the cost and process of learning. Finally, I am looking to conduct a performance assessment because Saxon Math provides assessments for me that I can utilize. Because I am pressed for time and typical parents don’t have the ability to both create and conduct assessments, I utilize what I have at my disposal. So, the performance evaluation through the use of Saxon Math assessments are what is most appropriate to me considering time and ability constraints.<br />
Validity of Assessment<br />
Validity is a determinant of whether or not an assessment measures what it is intended to measure. Because I am attempting to make a summative evaluation of the course material in that I am deciding whether or not to continue using the Saxon Math 5/4 course as a curriculum for my child, my assessment having validity would be an appropriate means to determine that summative judgement. I want to be sure that I am not wasting my time or my child’s time by giving him or her a curriculum that is not effective to him or her, or that if it is effective, that my assessment was inappropriate in validity and that I take that curriculum away from him or her because I mistakenly assumed that the curriculum was not appropriate. Having a structured assessment like a rubric can help me to stay on track with the intended assessment of the curriculum. I can go beyond face validity by introducing different types of validity such as item validity. Furthermore, I can also determine sampling validity on my own because of the small amount of material being covered in the first lesson. The mathematical problems are addition, and the highest sum of numbers only goes to 18. Because of that, I can create an assessment that accurately samples a variety of different problems that are still relevant to the lesson and has appropriate validity. Furthermore, by ensuring that I stick to addition facts, identification of addends and sums, and the ability to write number sentences from the rolling of two physical dice, I can appropriately assess the learning while maintaining validity. Earlier before my assessment was returned to me, I created a rubric of a collection of data to determine a correlational cause between students that have taken the Robinson curriculum and their SAT scores. Because the task assessment asks me to elaborate on different types of validity, I will continue to use that example. For example, the SAT examination could be said to have sampling validity. That is, it is able to take from a large curriculum normally associated with a high-school education and sample bits and pieces of that curriculum into a test which covers the that entire breadth of knowledge in a relatively short amount of questions for the material covered. Furthermore, the SAT also has content validity because there is a panel of experts determining that the test accurately measures what is being traditionally taught in a high-school education.<br />
