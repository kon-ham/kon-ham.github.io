<p>A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College of<br />
Western Governors University</p>

<p>Evaluation Plan<br />
The program I will be evaluating will be my own lesson plan assignment in JPT2. The goal of instruction is as follows: “10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.” In this lesson plan I teach military service members the basics of electrical theory and safety. The lesson plan is separated into three different units. Each unit will be taught in the same day with breaks in between. The lesson plan’s depth of ranges from teaching brief subatomic theory of electrons to practical identification of conductors, semi-conductors, and insulators, to the identification of the application of electrical theory and practice in the daily lives of the students.<br />
This lesson plan is uniquely targeted toward military service members with the understanding that the motivation toward this type of training and instructing being very low. Typical training done in the military is mandatory and can sometimes be very dense in material and covering a wide area of information in a short amount of time. These service members tend to have a negative opinion towards the training and have the association with training and lesson plans with boring and dry information. Therefore, the information in this specific lesson plan is cut into three separate parts to allow for breaks as well as giving people constructivist opportunities to make real life connections to their subjective experiences in the learning process.<br />
Description of Audience<br />
The demographics are as follows. 90% of the target population is male. 10% of the population is female. That is, of the 50 service members at the military base, 5 of them are female. All 50 will be in attendance for this lesson plan. All of these service members are military members. They will have had a similar background in their military training in that they all went through military indoctrination training when they first enlisted. Of the 50 service members, 3 are African American, 3 are Asian American, 12 are Hispanic/Latino, and the rest identify as White. Of the 50 service members, six have advanced degrees beyond high-school. The attitude towards this lesson plan is as mentioned above. Cultural characteristics are associated with the military background that these service members share – that is, there is a distinct language, customs and courtesies and behavior that is expected from military members that is foreign to a person that has not been trained in that culture.<br />
Type and Purpose of Evaluation<br />
This is a formative evaluation. Evaluation is needed so that curriculum can improve for the needs and instruction of the student, and to inform stakeholders that the curriculum is worth the continued funding or to determine its total effectiveness. Evaluation is a necessary part of the process of curriculum development in many different ways. One way is that rarely does the initial design of the curriculum created target the intended goals. Formative evaluation allows for quality improvement for the student. Sometimes this can be correcting syntax and spelling errors in the lesson, or to create more clearer instruction for the student. This formative evaluation is done because mistakes an unfortunate reality of human effort. Furthermore, the curriculum designer takes the humble approach in assuming that he or she does not know all of the answers and that the process, just like the learning process for the student, is always an ongoing and continuing process of improvement. Summative evaluation takes the quantitative data gleaned from formative evaluation and other data to make final judgement calls about the overall effectiveness of the course. For summative evaluation the question can be asked, “what was the overall impact of the course or curriculum?”. Specifically, in the case of my own lesson plan, formative evaluation is absolutely necessary because this is my first lesson plan. There is most certainly room for error. Furthermore, since this lesson plan still needs to be coordinated with the commanding officer and to be placed in his hands for final approval, formative evaluation will certainly need to occur after the commanding officer places his remarks and modifications on the lesson plan to more suitably fit the overall mission objectives for the base as he sees fit.<br />
Evaluation Questions<br />
The focus of my lesson plan is as follows. First, I want to make a lesson plan that ties in subjective experience in the constructivist fashion to learning. Second, I want to utilize behaviorism to teach learners discrimination between types of conductors and insulators, utilizing candy as a motivation to answer correctly as well as make the class exciting. Finally, I want to be sure that learners absorb that electricity though is only visible in an abstract way, makes our lives so much easier and productive. I want learners to have a sense of wonder and awe of how man has harnessed such a powerful and useful force. The questions I wish to ask relating to formative evaluation relating to the levels of interest and curiosity sparked in the learner after the lesson, confidence in being able to explain and understand subatomic theory, and finally, how all of the conceptual abstract models of the subatomic theory translate into useful application in the learner’s own personal world.<br />
Did the learners find satisfaction in the types of conductors and insulators that they were able to touch and feel to be wide ranging and full of variety? Were the few examples passed around in class enough to provide students a sense of connection between valence electrons and physically visible objects?<br />
Was the type of candy passed around to those that answered the question motivation enough to solidify the learning between valence electron diagrams and reward? Or should instead of candy a variety of stickers be passed around instead?<br />
Is the PowerPoint presentation utilized in all of the slides lacking in useful information? Is there any redundant information that could confuse the learner? Are there common spelling and grammatical errors that would cause a distraction to the learning process for the learner?<br />
Potential Interview<br />
In this interview I am wanting to ask the learners if they had felt any sense of confidence in their understanding of electricity. My second-fold desire for learners would be that they have a greater appreciation of how a concept or an idea can be made visible in the physical dimension. That is, understanding how valence electrons can be manipulated in order to make electricity flow from one component to energizing another. The interview process would be useful to me because I can ask the interviewees to be able to summarize the lesson plan. In this summary I would look for key phrases or frequency of terms that I would establish as patterns as I finish interviewing all 10 participants. Furthermore, I can ask if there was any sort of fulfilment of learning, a kind of joy that comes with challenging learning material and the feeling of progression. The interview would allow me to ask a question that could lead the interview participant to elaborate on those topics. The interview would be conducted as myself being the interviewer and 10 random selections or volunteers to be held as interviewees.<br />
Interview Questions<br />
When designing my lesson plan, I attempted to involve the learners, you, as much as possible in hopes that I would be able to provide a meaningful and perhaps a fun and exciting course on what is typically considered dry material. Did you find that I came close to that original intent?<br />
If you did not feel I came close to this intent, would you please elaborate on ways that I could have provided for more learner participation and to provide an environment that encouraged a sense of excitement of learning?<br />
In this lesson plan you were taught basics of valence electrons and how those electrons translate into the ability to conduct or insulate electron flow. You were able to hold in your hands different types of material that were either conductors, semi-conductors, or insulators. Did you feel that holding the material in your hands helped to solidify the connection between valence electron theory and the physical object you held in your hand?<br />
In the first lesson you were allowed to stand up and move around acting as electron bodies. Did you feel that being able to participate in a physical activity helped to solidify your knowledge of the theory of electrons?<br />
In the final lesson plan, you were asked to draw an application of electricity. This lesson plan was to encourage a cool down process from an entire day’s worth of learning and to encourage learners to be creative and to “let loose.” Did you feel that drawing the application of electrical theory helped you to think creatively about the usefulness of electricity in your own life?<br />
If you were the curriculum instructor, what would you have done differently or changed in order to facilitate a smoother and overall more efficient learning process for the learners?<br />
Electricity is considered by some to be an intimidating concept. Did you feel the lesson plan overall helped you to overcome any sort of intimidation you may have had in understanding electricity? And if you had no prior intimidation towards the subject, did you feel your time was well worth sitting through the entire class?<br />
What is the biggest takeaway you feel you received from going through this lesson plan?<br />
Type of Interview<br />
I am utilizing an open-response in person interview because of the fact that I am looking for motivation and attitude towards the subject of electrical theory. I am looking for changed attitudes toward the subject and often times attitudes are usually conveyed in feelings and abstract concepts. I am looking for a sense of fulfillment from the learners that they are able to grasp a conceptual idea of electrical theory and to feel confident enough to utilize that knowledge into a greater appreciation of electricity. Furthermore, I am colleagues with these learners. I am on a friendly basis with them, so being able to have open-ended interview questions will allow me to convey myself in the same manner that I have known them – that is, on a friendly and casual level. However, the major downside to the interview process is that if I am unfamiliar with interviewing, there will be a learning curve for me to overcome. I choose this over another interview platform such as telephone interviews because I occupy the same building space as the learners that I am targeting and seeking an interview from. Although I have the advantage of not having to build rapport with my target population because I am already known to these people, the lack of observation of body language and eye contact may cause my subjects to feel that quick answer can be given or worse, that a miscommunication can happen between myself and the interviewer because body language and eye contact is not involved. Finally, unlike other questionnaires or surveys, I can probe deeper into the motivations of a person. I am looking for clues as to how a person might become more interested in electrical theory or to find associations that a person finds interest it so that I can tie that association into the study and appreciation of electricity. The interview process over all over processes, allows me to probe deepest into that person’s motivations and interests.<br />
Potential Questionnaire/Survey<br />
The evaluations are summarized as follows. I am seeking an understanding in a change of attitude and behavior. I am looking specifically for a greater appreciation towards electrical theory and how it applies to the lives of people. That is, that people can appreciate the modern amenities offered in the application of the power source known as electricity. In this lesson plan, I am looking for people to understand electrical theory in observable behavior through physical activities in a behaviorist perspective. Furthermore, I am looking to make a subjective experience within the learner to make a connection with the lesson plan. I am doing this by allowing learners to draw and to have a hand’s on approach to the lesson. Therefore, the questions will attempt to capture in a quantitative form student’s subjective experiences with the learning material and whether or not the student felt the lesson plan was fulfilling, exciting, and applicable to his or her own life. Finally, I can utilize the questionnaire because I will have 50 learners and due to time constraints, interviewing all 50 will be prohibitive for me. This is the value that I can glean from the survey.<br />
