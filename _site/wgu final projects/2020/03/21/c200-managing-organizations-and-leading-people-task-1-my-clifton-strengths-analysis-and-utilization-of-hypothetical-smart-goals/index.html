<meta name="description" content="Clifton Categorical Strengths Context is the strength that indicates that I am interested in looking into the past to discover the solutions to the problems that are in the present. This strength drives me to build a framework of understanding in order to navigate through the present demands of the world. This is a strength that compels me to look to experts to find solutions. The Context strength can be maximized with a person that is future oriented. I may be able to utilize past cultural objects to imbue towards my followers to help them to be energized in current projects. A negative of this strength would be that I may be too rigid concerning change. The Learner strength indicates that I am inclined to soaking up information and learning new skills because I find learning and discovering new facts as pleasurable. This strength drives me to improve on my own current skills because I feel challenged to address my own shortcomings. When addressing people, learning why a person may be motivated to act a certain way is how I gain satisfaction, giving me a well of information, facts, and data from which I add to my mental library. The Input strength is that I enjoy the accumulation of facts and data. I am constantly thinking. I may enjoy learning new vocabulary or viewing all factors in a situation. This disadvantage can be that I could be inclined to draw data and information and then to horde the data or that I might begin to gather trivial data impulsively. Secondly, I must be able to utilize the data I collect for the advantage of others not merely for my own enjoyment. Individualization is the strength that indicates that I see people individually. I enjoy watching people and I like to observe differences between people to differentiate one person to another. Because I view people through individual differences, I tend to weigh my decisions carefully to consider all the variety of factors. I am likely to be logical and I can be trusted to be cautious with my decisions. Because I can see the unique characteristics of people, I can utilize that skill to help people to reach their goals by capitalizing on their abilities. Deliberative strength indicates that I am inclined to break down complex processes to its smallest parts. I believe in taking my time with these processes. I may be slow to compliments because I am careful with my comments. I do not enjoy gossiping. I may be well suited for jobs that help me to give advice or to counsel others. I must be sure to convey that I am not being tentative with my actions but rather than I am carefully weighing the risks between each decision. Three Positive Traits According to Transformational Leadership A positive trait of the context strength is that I can utilize historical framework and context to provide my employees or followers a higher sense of morality or values to encourage ethical behavior. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) Looking toward the past to search for how people used to live or act can help me to give a vision to my organization in that I help them to see a progressive timeline of history in that we can look to the past to make the future a better place to be. Utilizing individualization, I can utilize transformational leadership to support my people to become better people morally. I view that everyone is one of a kind. This means that I view people as individuals with unique talents and abilities that can be driven to push for higher organizational goals. Knowing how each of my followers operates based on their upbringing, how they view the world, themselves, and others, can help me to drive their ability further. The input strength indicates that I am inclined to soak up knowledge to the best of my ability. I enjoy learning new things and that I like to then collect that data for later usage. Morality and ethics are not a static concept, but rather they are dynamic, or constantly changing in application and daily practical usage of the principals. This means that I can lead my organization by utilizing my input skill to raise new questions concerning ethics and morality and then to address those questions to my organization. (2013) Three Weaknesses According to Transformational Leadership The first weakness is through the individualization strength. I am encouraged to cultivate the traits of each of my individual followers. I am encouraged to take their skills, strengths, and goals as well as their differences from their cultural outlook and upbringing to bring the best out of them. Transformational leadership utilizes the approach of expressing the positive emotions to “serve as a charismatic role model to followers.” (Szu-han, Brent, &amp; Fadel, 2019) In my approach to ensuring each individual is catered to in their own uniqueness, I may have to express positive emotions even when I am not feeling well, or, emotionally regulate (2019), in order to achieve follower success, which is costly to a leader because the leader becomes emotionally exhausted. (2019) Second, my trait of being a learner may be helpful to my employees or followers because I am able to bring new skill sets to contribute to the organization due to my lifelong desire to learn and to grow simply for the sake and pleasure of learning. Because of that, I may have an easier time adapting to new standards or procedures that the company must utilize in order to stay competitive or to stay within regulation. As a transformational leader, I will have to convince my followers through persuasion that the new way of doing things is the right way to do things. This also contributes to being taxed with my finite mental resources. (2019) This may also cost time and money because transformational leaders must convince followers who may be committed to a routine because routines are comfortable. Finally, the context strengths propel me to look toward the past to discover solutions to the present. This behavior can be attributed to transformational leadership as intellectual stimulation, or, the “stimulating followers’ creativity by challenging existing assumptions.” (2019) While the context strength explains that I may be looking to history to build existing framework, I may find that additional resources are expended in order to convey to followers that one, the historical lessons in which I find context have validity and two, that those historical facts are relevant to the building of the framework which is needed now to reach a solution. All three of these weaknesses are based on the conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership. That is, that individuals behave in a manner that best aligns with their ability to reserve resources to their advantage. (2019) This theory holds that emotional exhaustion indicates a “depletion of resources.” (2019) The majority of transformational leadership has measured the effect the leadership theory has on the followers. The conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership indicates that while followers may benefit from transformational leadership and the above three Clifton Strengths attributes, my weaknesses of transformational leadership indicates that I may be inclined to a major loss of my own mental resources in order to push followers to greater productivity. Three Actionable Steps The first step I would utilize would be to point toward my context strength. Context helps me to look to past precedents to understand the present situation. Because I enjoy looking towards the past for solutions, I am in a prime position to share that desire also with my employees so that they would be inspired to reach their own vision about the organization. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) I could encourage them to look to past problems the company has had and how that problem was overcome, or if the problem was not overcome, how the problem looks like now having had some hindsight. I could utilize the past conflicts other companies have had to help my current organization to overcome similar situations or perhaps to even apply past solutions to our present problems. Utilizing the individualization context, I could take the time to interview my followers or employees to find out what makes them unique. After interviewing those people, I could create a basic list of makes each of my colleague’s desire to grow and to learn, and what sort of goals they have for the future. With this knowledge, I can help my followers to become better people, a key concept of transformational leadership. (2013) During this process I could also explain to my colleagues that I view each people as a unique individual, and that I while I may seem to be partial to one person, I can try to explain that it is a justifiably right thing to treat each individually on a case-by-case basis, and that I own expectation is to treat all individuals as special and unique. Finally, I can utilize my learner trait to help employees to achieve higher organizational goals that may not inherently be their own by instilling in the employees a sense of joy in learning new concepts. Transformational leadership is the process by which employees internalize the values and goals of the organization into their own. (2013) This can be utilized by sharing with my organization a love for learning. I could make learning about the ethics and values of the organization into a fun game or into a social event to encourage the process of internalization. Two Short Term SMART Goals The first SMART goal would be to improve my academic skills relating to writing and studying within a period of two weeks. Because I am currently enrolled in an MBA program, I want to be sure that I write clearly and that I utilize the time I spend studying effectively. I have determined that the best way improve my academic skill is to be sure to set a short-term goal of improving those skills. I have decided first to take an online course in academic writing and second, to learn to utilize the Pomodoro technique for studying through the online course. The Pomodoro technique is to measure 25 minutes of study time with a timer. When the timer ends, make a checkmark for completion of study time, take a 3-5-minute break utilizing the timer, and then repeat. After four Pomodoro sessions, I can then take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. After four checkmarks, I can then start from scratch again and reset my breaks. The second SMART goal would be to be more well-read by the end of month. Specifically, I want to be able to read four more chapters of Edward Banfield’s “The Unheavenly City” as well as improving my vocabulary. Reading is a great way to develop comprehension skills. To a certain degree, I want to read novels that are above my reading and comprehension ability in order to challenge myself and to keep myself from becoming comfortable with complacency. Developing a reading program that utilizes learning vocabulary as well as consistent reading will help me to become more well-read by the end of the month as well as learning to utilize learning new vocabulary in order to become more well-read. Specific Actions to Achieve SMART Goals A specific goal I would like to achieve would be to develop my academic writing skills in order to increase my chances of writing clearly so that I can complete my MBA course. Specifically, I will attend and complete the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that is available on https://www.edx.org, enroll by January 29, and complete the course in two weeks, by working on the course for one hour every other day. I will measure my progress by tracking the hourly progress in a spreadsheet I have created separately. The final measure of the progress will be completion of the course by the end of a two-week progress. This is attainable to me because I have access to the internet and I also have an hour every other day to be able to contribute to the study of the course. Finally, because it is free to me, attending the course is not cost-prohibitive. This training is relevant to me because I am currently attending an MBA course which includes mostly written work. I must write clearly to make my points in order to achieve success in this program. The time frame of completion for this course will be the end of two weeks. Secondly, I will specifically utilize the Pomodoro technique in the studying of the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that I take on January 29. This technique utilizes studying for 25-minute intervals, making a physical checkmark for each interval, and then taking a 3-5-minute break between each interval. At the end of the fourth interval, I can then take a longer break of 15-30-minutes only to restart the entire cycle at the end of the longer break. This process is measurable because I can look at every checkmark that I’ve made for each study session. I can measure how long I am studying for by utilizing the timer. This is attainable because I simply utilize pen and paper to record my study interval checkmarks. A timer is also cheap to purchase. This is relevant to me because I am learning to become more efficient at academic writing. I will also need to learn how to better focus my time to studying. The Pomodoro technique encourages a conditioned and methodical approach to studying. The time frame of completion correlates to the end of my “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course. By the end of the session I hope to better utilize the Pomodoro technique for my learning ability or to determine if the Pomodoro technique is not relevant to my studying style. First, I would like to achieve reading four more chapters of The Unheavenly City: Revisited” by Edward Banfield by the end of February. It is measurable because I have allotted myself 30 minutes every other day to the reading of the book, so I am able to track my progress. It is attainable because I have the time available every other day to devote 30 minutes to reading the book. It is relevant to me because the Unheavenly City relates to sociological trends and as a result a future prediction of what cities and societies will look like in America. Looking at these problems in an academic perspective helps me to consider future solutions to present problems that ail American society. The time frame I have given myself to finish the four chapters is the end of February. Secondly, I intend to download the Vocabulary.com app onto my phone. Then, before I read “The Unheavenly City”, I will utilize 10 minutes on top of my 30-minute reading session to playing vocabulary games on my phone. This 10-minute session will be a conditioning to associate two actions, reading “The Unheavenly City” and increasing my vocabulary with the stated goal to becoming more well-read. The Vocabulary.com app utilizes computer algorithms to cater vocabulary words to my skill level. Playing a game with vocabulary helps me to solidify my learning. This is measurable because the app will tell me how many times I’ve used the app including time and date usage. It is attainable because the vocabulary is learned in a fun manner. It is relevant to my goal of becoming more well-read because to become well-read is also to have a diverse vocabulary. This is also time bound because I will revise my goal after the end of the month of completing four chapters of “The Unheavenly City”. References Szu-han, L., Brent, S. A., &amp; Fadel, M. K. (2019).

Morality and ethics are not a static concept, but rather they are dynamic, or constantly changing in application and daily practical usage of the principals. This means that I can lead my organization by utilizing my input skill to raise new questions concerning ethics and morality and then to address those questions to my organization. (2013) Three Weaknesses According to Transformational Leadership The first weakness is through the individualization strength. I am encouraged to cultivate the traits of each of my individual followers. I am encouraged to take their skills, strengths, and goals as well as their differences from their cultural outlook and upbringing to bring the best out of them. Transformational leadership utilizes the approach of expressing the positive emotions to “serve as a charismatic role model to followers.” (Szu-han, Brent, &amp; Fadel, 2019) In my approach to ensuring each individual is catered to in their own uniqueness, I may have to express positive emotions even when I am not feeling well, or, emotionally regulate (2019), in order to achieve follower success, which is costly to a leader because the leader becomes emotionally exhausted. (2019) Second, my trait of being a learner may be helpful to my employees or followers because I am able to bring new skill sets to contribute to the organization due to my lifelong desire to learn and to grow simply for the sake and pleasure of learning. Because of that, I may have an easier time adapting to new standards or procedures that the company must utilize in order to stay competitive or to stay within regulation. As a transformational leader, I will have to convince my followers through persuasion that the new way of doing things is the right way to do things. This also contributes to being taxed with my finite mental resources. (2019) This may also cost time and money because transformational leaders must convince followers who may be committed to a routine because routines are comfortable. Finally, the context strengths propel me to look toward the past to discover solutions to the present. This behavior can be attributed to transformational leadership as intellectual stimulation, or, the “stimulating followers’ creativity by challenging existing assumptions.” (2019) While the context strength explains that I may be looking to history to build existing framework, I may find that additional resources are expended in order to convey to followers that one, the historical lessons in which I find context have validity and two, that those historical facts are relevant to the building of the framework which is needed now to reach a solution. All three of these weaknesses are based on the conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership. That is, that individuals behave in a manner that best aligns with their ability to reserve resources to their advantage. (2019) This theory holds that emotional exhaustion indicates a “depletion of resources.” (2019) The majority of transformational leadership has measured the effect the leadership theory has on the followers. The conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership indicates that while followers may benefit from transformational leadership and the above three Clifton Strengths attributes, my weaknesses of transformational leadership indicates that I may be inclined to a major loss of my own mental resources in order to push followers to greater productivity. Three Actionable Steps The first step I would utilize would be to point toward my context strength. Context helps me to look to past precedents to understand the present situation. Because I enjoy looking towards the past for solutions, I am in a prime position to share that desire also with my employees so that they would be inspired to reach their own vision about the organization. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) I could encourage them to look to past problems the company has had and how that problem was overcome, or if the problem was not overcome, how the problem looks like now having had some hindsight. I could utilize the past conflicts other companies have had to help my current organization to overcome similar situations or perhaps to even apply past solutions to our present problems. Utilizing the individualization context, I could take the time to interview my followers or employees to find out what makes them unique. After interviewing those people, I could create a basic list of makes each of my colleague’s desire to grow and to learn, and what sort of goals they have for the future. With this knowledge, I can help my followers to become better people, a key concept of transformational leadership. (2013) During this process I could also explain to my colleagues that I view each people as a unique individual, and that I while I may seem to be partial to one person, I can try to explain that it is a justifiably right thing to treat each individually on a case-by-case basis, and that I own expectation is to treat all individuals as special and unique. Finally, I can utilize my learner trait to help employees to achieve higher organizational goals that may not inherently be their own by instilling in the employees a sense of joy in learning new concepts. Transformational leadership is the process by which employees internalize the values and goals of the organization into their own. (2013) This can be utilized by sharing with my organization a love for learning. I could make learning about the ethics and values of the organization into a fun game or into a social event to encourage the process of internalization. Two Short Term SMART Goals The first SMART goal would be to improve my academic skills relating to writing and studying within a period of two weeks. Because I am currently enrolled in an MBA program, I want to be sure that I write clearly and that I utilize the time I spend studying effectively. I have determined that the best way improve my academic skill is to be sure to set a short-term goal of improving those skills. I have decided first to take an online course in academic writing and second, to learn to utilize the Pomodoro technique for studying through the online course. The Pomodoro technique is to measure 25 minutes of study time with a timer. When the timer ends, make a checkmark for completion of study time, take a 3-5-minute break utilizing the timer, and then repeat. After four Pomodoro sessions, I can then take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. After four checkmarks, I can then start from scratch again and reset my breaks. The second SMART goal would be to be more well-read by the end of month. Specifically, I want to be able to read four more chapters of Edward Banfield’s “The Unheavenly City” as well as improving my vocabulary. Reading is a great way to develop comprehension skills. To a certain degree, I want to read novels that are above my reading and comprehension ability in order to challenge myself and to keep myself from becoming comfortable with complacency. Developing a reading program that utilizes learning vocabulary as well as consistent reading will help me to become more well-read by the end of the month as well as learning to utilize learning new vocabulary in order to become more well-read. Specific Actions to Achieve SMART Goals A specific goal I would like to achieve would be to develop my academic writing skills in order to increase my chances of writing clearly so that I can complete my MBA course. Specifically, I will attend and complete the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that is available on https://www.edx.org, enroll by January 29, and complete the course in two weeks, by working on the course for one hour every other day. I will measure my progress by tracking the hourly progress in a spreadsheet I have created separately. The final measure of the progress will be completion of the course by the end of a two-week progress. This is attainable to me because I have access to the internet and I also have an hour every other day to be able to contribute to the study of the course. Finally, because it is free to me, attending the course is not cost-prohibitive. This training is relevant to me because I am currently attending an MBA course which includes mostly written work. I must write clearly to make my points in order to achieve success in this program. The time frame of completion for this course will be the end of two weeks. Secondly, I will specifically utilize the Pomodoro technique in the studying of the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that I take on January 29. This technique utilizes studying for 25-minute intervals, making a physical checkmark for each interval, and then taking a 3-5-minute break between each interval. At the end of the fourth interval, I can then take a longer break of 15-30-minutes only to restart the entire cycle at the end of the longer break. This process is measurable because I can look at every checkmark that I’ve made for each study session. I can measure how long I am studying for by utilizing the timer. This is attainable because I simply utilize pen and paper to record my study interval checkmarks. A timer is also cheap to purchase. This is relevant to me because I am learning to become more efficient at academic writing. I will also need to learn how to better focus my time to studying. The Pomodoro technique encourages a conditioned and methodical approach to studying. The time frame of completion correlates to the end of my “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course. By the end of the session I hope to better utilize the Pomodoro technique for my learning ability or to determine if the Pomodoro technique is not relevant to my studying style. First, I would like to achieve reading four more chapters of The Unheavenly City: Revisited” by Edward Banfield by the end of February. It is measurable because I have allotted myself 30 minutes every other day to the reading of the book, so I am able to track my progress. It is attainable because I have the time available every other day to devote 30 minutes to reading the book. It is relevant to me because the Unheavenly City relates to sociological trends and as a result a future prediction of what cities and societies will look like in America. Looking at these problems in an academic perspective helps me to consider future solutions to present problems that ail American society. The time frame I have given myself to finish the four chapters is the end of February. Secondly, I intend to download the Vocabulary.com app onto my phone. Then, before I read “The Unheavenly City”, I will utilize 10 minutes on top of my 30-minute reading session to playing vocabulary games on my phone. This 10-minute session will be a conditioning to associate two actions, reading “The Unheavenly City” and increasing my vocabulary with the stated goal to becoming more well-read. The Vocabulary.com app utilizes computer algorithms to cater vocabulary words to my skill level. Playing a game with vocabulary helps me to solidify my learning. This is measurable because the app will tell me how many times I’ve used the app including time and date usage. It is attainable because the vocabulary is learned in a fun manner. It is relevant to my goal of becoming more well-read because to become well-read is also to have a diverse vocabulary. This is also time bound because I will revise my goal after the end of the month of completing four chapters of “The Unheavenly City”. References Szu-han, L., Brent, S. A., &amp; Fadel, M. K. (2019).

  <p>Clifton Categorical Strengths<br />
Context is the strength that indicates that I am interested in looking into the past to discover the solutions to the problems that are in the present. This strength drives me to build a framework of understanding in order to navigate through the present demands of the world. This is a strength that compels me to look to experts to find solutions. The Context strength can be maximized with a person that is future oriented. I may be able to utilize past cultural objects to imbue towards my followers to help them to be energized in current projects. A negative of this strength would be that I may be too rigid concerning change.<br />
The Learner strength indicates that I am inclined to soaking up information and learning new skills because I find learning and discovering new facts as pleasurable. This strength drives me to improve on my own current skills because I feel challenged to address my own shortcomings. When addressing people, learning why a person may be motivated to act a certain way is how I gain satisfaction, giving me a well of information, facts, and data from which I add to my mental library.<br />
The Input strength is that I enjoy the accumulation of facts and data. I am constantly thinking. I may enjoy learning new vocabulary or viewing all factors in a situation. This disadvantage can be that I could be inclined to draw data and information and then to horde the data or that I might begin to gather trivial data impulsively. Secondly, I must be able to utilize the data I collect for the advantage of others not merely for my own enjoyment.<br />
Individualization is the strength that indicates that I see people individually. I enjoy watching people and I like to observe differences between people to differentiate one person to another. Because I view people through individual differences, I tend to weigh my decisions carefully to consider all the variety of factors. I am likely to be logical and I can be trusted to be cautious with my decisions. Because I can see the unique characteristics of people, I can utilize that skill to help people to reach their goals by capitalizing on their abilities.<br />
Deliberative strength indicates that I am inclined to break down complex processes to its smallest parts. I believe in taking my time with these processes. I may be slow to compliments because I am careful with my comments. I do not enjoy gossiping. I may be well suited for jobs that help me to give advice or to counsel others. I must be sure to convey that I am not being tentative with my actions but rather than I am carefully weighing the risks between each decision.<br />
Three Positive Traits According to Transformational Leadership<br />
A positive trait of the context strength is that I can utilize historical framework and context to provide my employees or followers a higher sense of morality or values to encourage ethical behavior. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) Looking toward the past to search for how people used to live or act can help me to give a vision to my organization in that I help them to see a progressive timeline of history in that we can look to the past to make the future a better place to be.<br />
Utilizing individualization, I can utilize transformational leadership to support my people to become better people morally. I view that everyone is one of a kind. This means that I view people as individuals with unique talents and abilities that can be driven to push for higher organizational goals. Knowing how each of my followers operates based on their upbringing, how they view the world, themselves, and others, can help me to drive their ability further.<br />
The input strength indicates that I am inclined to soak up knowledge to the best of my ability. I enjoy learning new things and that I like to then collect that data for later usage. Morality and ethics are not a static concept, but rather they are dynamic, or constantly changing in application and daily practical usage of the principals. This means that I can lead my organization by utilizing my input skill to raise new questions concerning ethics and morality and then to address those questions to my organization. (2013)<br />
