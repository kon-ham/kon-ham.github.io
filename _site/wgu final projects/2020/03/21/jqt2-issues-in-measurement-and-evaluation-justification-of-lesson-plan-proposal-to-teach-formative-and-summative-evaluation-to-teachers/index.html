<p>JQT2 Task Assessment<br />
Introduction<br />
I will utilize a formative and summative evaluation in order to determine the effectiveness of my workshop. In my hypothetical workshop, I am teaching on the formative and summative evaluation process and how it relates to overall enhanced learning for the students and the ability to make judgement calls of a curriculum for stakeholders and other invested persons. I want to be able to teach teachers – those involved in the grades K-12 how to better apply formative and summative processes in their own curriculum.<br />
Learning Objectives<br />
Learners will be able to demonstrate the understanding of formative and summative evaluation after the end of the instruction by participating in a group discussion of the summative and formative evaluation process and by participating in a questionnaire measuring attitude before and after the instruction in which a change in attitude concerning the value of formative and summative evaluations is observed.<br />
Desired Outcomes<br />
Learners will be able to think critically, abstractly, and with a broad horizonal view of the implications of a curriculum in a young child’s life by utilizing formative and summative evaluation processes by which important decisions can be made to further facilitate a smoother learning experience for a child, or for the stakeholders invested in the curriculum to be able to make the most important judgement call: “Is this curriculum worth the money we are spending on it?”<br />
Intended Audience<br />
The intended audience would be between the ages of 21 to 65. The audience would be teachers or those interested in becoming teachers. It is likely that they will be college degree holding individuals. The majority of teachers tend to be female, so I suppose that I could estimate approximately 80% of the learners being female and 20% of the target population being male. Their attitudes toward the subject is likely that they are aware of the formative and summative evaluation process. They may view the subject with monotony. They are probably familiar with the industry terms.<br />
Relevance of the Topic to the Intended Audience<br />
Curriculum is a strategic educational plan that must prioritize the learning of one skill over another. Because of time constraints, it is simply not possible to teach everything to everybody or every child. This is why important decisions must be made concerning what is important for a child to learn in order to become a successful in the eyes of the stakeholders involved. Furthermore, because what is considered successful in one’s own perspective varies wildly with another, it becomes evident that the potential for variance in an educational curriculum is great. Because curriculum must adapt to the changing needs of the student or learner as well as maintaining relevancy in an increasingly changing world, the need for formative and summative processes becomes clear. The formative and summative process helps educators to ask the tough questions: “Is this curriculum relevant to our and the stakeholder’s needs?” and, “Is this learning being facilitated as smoothly and as efficiently as possible for the learner?” Teachers have a moral responsibility to deliver the highest quality of information in regards to a curriculum because a learner must invest his or her time into the program. Time is the greatest cost to all people. Valuable time spent on one curriculum means that the same time spent on one curriculum is not being spent on another curriculum, potentially one that is greater or exceedingly greater than the curriculum a student is currently enrolled in. The formative and summative process of evaluation helps us to minimize the amount of time wasted.</p>

<p>Formative Evaluation<br />
Evaluating Workshop Materials before the Workshop and during the Field Trial<br />
I would begin a process of formative evaluation by utilizing the first three phases of formative evaluation. That is, the one-to-one process, the small group process, and the field trial process. The one-to-one process allows me to interview the learners so that I can know the errors in my work. Within this first process, I can use the help of subject matter experts or others that are familiar with the material in order to further seek out potential errors in the information. (Dick, Carey, &amp; Carey, 2009) Secondly, the small group process takes the number of errors and makes corrections and the small group interview allows for me to follow through with my errors in the curriculum, and to gather quantitative and qualitative data. During this second phase targeted populations of learners are utilized for the evaluation of the curriculum. Finally, a field trial is conducted based on the revisions made during the first and second phase of the formative evaluation process. Here finally further revisions are made to the curriculum but specifically, the curriculum is conducted in an environment similar to the actual scenario in which the curriculum is taking place. This final process is where the evaluator makes little to no interactions on the learner. The first two phases involved evaluator involvement for the purposes of data collection. Here the evaluator only makes data collection through the use of the learner or the evaluator.<br />
I have determined these phases as a result of a creation of a matrix. Within this matrix, I develop questions that are relevant to my form of instruction. These questions can be as follows: “Is the material relevant to the instruction?”, “Are the instructions given to the learners clear?”, and “Is the material relevant to the needs of the learners?”. (2009) These questions guide the framework for my matrix in which I am attempting to answer questions necessary to make the learning process for my learners a clear and relevant experience. This process is known as the instructional strategy. Preceding my three phases of formative evaluation I can also utilize subject matter experts to review my first draft of the design of my curriculum. This can be helpful to my formative evaluation process which helps me to narrow down the scope of my curriculum to what is directly relevant to the learners and stated objectives. Following that, I begin the previously stated three phases of formative evaluation. Within each process, there is a careful set of data collection that I need in order to ensure the curriculum is being instructed as intended. For example, in a one-to-one evaluation, the first phase of my formative evaluation, I may want descriptive data instead of quantitative data because I am looking for information related to the delivery of the instruction. I can ask questions to the subject relating to his or her motivation. Was the instruction boring? Did he or she lose interest before the instruction was finished? Once I interpret the data carefully, I determine useful information from the trials, which would be whether or not the instruction was appropriate. The small-group evaluation builds upon my formative evaluation determined in my one-to-one trials. Here I may wish to determine more quantitative data instead of deterministic data as the group of subjects is larger and that now at this point, I’ve developed necessary modifications from my one-to-one trials. Finally, with the combined data I’ve collected from the first two phases of my formative evaluation I can also build on those phases in my final phase process, which is the field trial. I can utilize the changes I’ve made from the first two phases of my evaluation and administer those changes to the field trials. At this point I must be careful not to determine the effectiveness of my curriculum on the basis on merely the field trial, as an appropriate pre and post test would help me to determine if the subjects had the necessary prerequisite knowledge in order to effectively navigate my curriculum.<br />
Justification of Tools before the Workshop<br />
The first format of data collection that I can use is the structured interview. I want to be sure that I am conducting my interviews in a consistent format to allow myself to stay on track. This form of data is qualitative in nature. That is, my respondents will present information and data to me in the form of a conversation. How can I quantify that? I could utilize frequency observations in my qualitative data by observing the amount of times I notice a certain word or phrase. In this structured interview, I am looking also to develop rapport with my learner. I want to assure the learner that because this is a formative evaluation of the product, any problems that a student may encounter in my curriculum can be the result of my own deficiencies of the curriculum. (Dick, Carey, &amp; Carey, 2009) Depending on that data collection, it could be a narrative format. Secondly, I can utilize a questionnaire based on a Likert scale format. This format is also good for me because it is also a part of my learning objectives. This data is quantitative because I can very easily translate the data into a numerical format and from there to make adjustments in my data to determine mean, median, and mode.<br />
Justification of Tools during the Field Trial of Workshop<br />
The field trial portion of my workshop will consist of a Likert scale questionnaire concerning attitude relating to formative and summative evaluations. Since a field trial is intended to be like a dress rehearsal (Dick, Carey, &amp; Carey, 2009) in that the field trial is intended to be most resembling of the actual workshop, I include all of my elements incorporated in my learning objectives. Stated earlier, I mentioned that learners should be able to participate in a group discussion concerning formative and summative evaluations, I can gather naturalistic observations of the participants in my workshop. Because I am gathering naturalistic observations of my learners participating in the group discussions, I am gathering qualitative data. Secondly, I am also gathering two questionnaires, one before the educational workshop and the second one after the end of the workshop and the end of the group discussions. Because I am using a Likert scale format, I can easily compute the data in a quantitative form. I utilize the naturalistic observation of learners because I want to determine if learners can have conversations about evaluations with other learners. Secondly, I am attempting to measure a change in attitude, which a Likert scale can be wholly appropriate for such a measurement.<br />
Summative Evaluation Process<br />
The summative evaluation process I intend to use is to first identify the level of congruence between my stated learning objectives and the informational material being transferred to my learners. I need to understand if my material is relevant to my learning objectives. Usually, this process is an attempt to meet the needs of the organization and the material being taught. That is, a company has an issue that needs to be resolved. The congruence phase of the summative process is what an evaluator utilizes in order to make the analyses and data necessary to determine the congruence of the organization’s value and mission statements with the material being taught in response to the previously mentioned issue. For me, because in this hypothetical situation I am the evaluator and I have invented a hypothetical workshop, I can determine whether or not my learning objectives meet my standards by evaluating my material. I want to know if my material transfers information to my learners. I might at this point utilize a content expert or subject matter expert to determine if my workshop meets the standards of learning I am attempting to transfer to my learners. Finally, I use the impact evaluation stage to determine if that information was transferred over to my learners. I can utilize a rating scale to determine this process. The same subject matter expert qualifies my information as being valid, and then the evaluator, in this case, myself as an internal evaluator, utilizes a rating scale to rate or judge my material. This can be listed in a form of subordinate skills or a list of requirements I deem necessary to determine if the material has made an impact upon the learner. From here, I can usually make the judgement in whether or not the workshop was a success for me or not.<br />
The first step of the summative evaluation process is to determine if the needs of the organization align with the intended outcome of the instructional process. This is called a congruence analysis. (2009) At this point as a designer and evaluator, I want to determine if the needs align with the curriculum by obtain company statements of values and goals as well as the job task description in order to better determine a judgement of whether or not the curriculum is relevant to the organization and job task. It may seem obvious, but the more relevant the curriculum, the more likely learners will be able to utilize those skills and to directly apply them to the job at hand. Usually what follows is another form of congruence analysis of the resources at hand relating to the curriculum. Questions to ask would be whether or not an organization can afford a budget to purchase relevant resources to supplement the curriculum, or whether or not subject matter experts can determine if the resources are relevant and up to date.<br />
The next step would be to determine a design analysis. Is the material relevant to the instruction? Identifying clearly learner traits and characteristics can help to make those determinations. (2009) This process can be considered also an evaluation of the delivery and overall “strategy” (2009) of the curriculum as opposed to the analysis of the learning materials itself. That is, it may be the delivery method of the curriculum as opposed to the learning materials that deems whether or not a curriculum has the ability to transfer the relevant materials from the instruction to the learners. Along with a pre-test and a post-test, evaluators can determine if the learning has been transferred to the learner. This is called the impact analysis. (2009) From here, an emphasis of evaluation transfers from the learner to the organization. (2009) The easiest way to put this process into simpler terms is this: “Does the curriculum work the way we want?” Below a few instruments of data collection are provided to demonstrate the impact analysis phase of the summative process. This process allows for the computation of the data to make the determination to the evaluator as well as other stakeholders the impact of the curriculum. A final note – it would be beneficial to the evaluator to include respondents for the collection of data, to include not only the learners themselves, the target population, but also managers and supervisors related to the learners. They too can provide input as to the relevancy and appropriateness of the instruction as it pertains to the overall needs of the organization.<br />
Justification of Tools at the End of the Workshop<br />
I will first utilize a frequency chart by making observations of my students as they interact in a group discussion of the material after the end of the workshop. As I make observations and annotations of the observations, I will take my qualitative data and determine frequency of key phrases or words that I am looking for to indicate that there was a form of transference of information from my workshop to the learners. This is taking my qualitative data and translating it into quantitative data. Secondly, I will utilize a rating skill chart to determine if my learners are meeting subordinate skills necessary to indicate the transference of information. This occurs during the same time I am making naturalistic observations of my learners in a group discussion. Finally, as mentioned earlier, I will utilize a Likert scale questionnaire to determine an attitude change in the formative and summative evaluation process in my learners. This is also quantifiable data.<br />
Furthermore, I want to be sure that the data collection instruments I utilize for my summative evaluation are catered to the needs of the hypothetical organizational purposes as well as actual relevancy to the job task needing adjustment. A practical instrument utilizing data collection can be a rating form for congruence analysis. Here I can utilize subject matter experts as well as supervisors to score on a rating chart the relevance of the curriculum in light of the needs of the organization. Not only can I utilize a rating chart for congruence analysis in the light of the organizational needs, I can also utilize a similar chart to determine relevancy of the content on the basis of my instructional goal. These response questions can help me to determine the overall effectiveness of the curriculum in relation to a summative evaluation. Because I am administering a workshop on the formative and summative processes of evaluation, I want to be sure that my information is relevant to the teachers that are taking my workshop in that they have the ability to take that knowledge and to apply it to their classrooms. Furthermore, being able to utilize a rating chart for relevancy toward the organization can help me to see if the information I am attempting to transfer is relevant to the organization as a whole that a teacher may report to.<br />
Use of Data<br />
My formative evaluation data should indicate to me common mistakes made during the process of the creation of a curriculum. That is, spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, unclear directions, or general vagueness in the material itself. Subject matter experts can determine this for me as they review my material to determine if there is any excess or insufficiencies with the material. The summative evaluation data should help me to determine if there was an overall effect of the material upon my learners. That is, did the material transfer the intended information to the learners? Subject matter experts help me to determine if my material was correct or current and the skills rating chart or questionnaires further me to determine the overall effectiveness of the curriculum and most importantly, if the curriculum is worth the cost of continuance as it currently stands.<br />
