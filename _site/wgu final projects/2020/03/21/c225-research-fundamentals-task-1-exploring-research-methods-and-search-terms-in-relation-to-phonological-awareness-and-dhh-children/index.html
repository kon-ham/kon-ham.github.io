<p>A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College</p>

<p>of Western Governors University</p>

<p>Education Related Research Topic<br />
I am looking to explore the impact phonological or phonics-based reading has on children that are hard of hearing and or deaf. I want to know if the phonics-based curriculum can have a positive and long last impact on children with the above-mentioned learning disabilities. Traditionally a phonics-based program can be effective for teaching young children to read because children are able to pronounce words as they hear the phonetic differences in each word. Deaf and/or hard of hearing children are presented with the challenge of being unable to hear clearly a phonetic structure of a word.<br />

Explanation of Usefulness<br />
I included hard of hearing for the majority of my search terms because I am looking for results relating to deaf and hard of hearing children. The best results for me were search terms that included hard of hearing, deaf, impact, reading comprehension, phonics, and children. I believe that reading comprehension and deaf children probably are the core words that brought me the most amount of search results. Using this search, I was able to discover that there was a great deal of interest in phonics and reading ability for young children with hearing disabilities. I think that further including search terms hard of hearing are likely superfluous because of the proper terminology of deaf children would also be to include deaf and/or hard of hearing, since there exists a spectrum of the total amount of hearing loss.</p>

Action research. The purpose was to determine the overall effectiveness of adopting a process of association of words to images to help DHH or deaf and hard of hearing children to make the necessary connections to develop the phenome and grapheme skills necessary to read. Traditionally, children are utilizing sounds and letters or symbols to make connections in the language acquisition process. Here in this study, Bergeron et al. publish a study to determine the overall effectiveness of an attempt to teach children the phenome and grapheme connections through the use of semantic association. That is, the letter m can be understood with a picture of a child with ice cream and the instructor saying “mmmm, that’s good.” (Bergeron, Easterbrooks, &amp; Connor, 2009) The results of the study show that semantic association to teach DHH children the phenome-grapheme correspondence works, (2009) especially in the case of individual children. The multisensory approach as well as an association that narrows the amount of “normal” language capability to transfer the knowledge of phenome-grapheme correspondence to an approach that suits DHH children can help DHH children to overcome significant obstacles relating to their learning disabilities. A strength of this study is that individual children can have instruction tailored to their own needs according to the level of hearing disability, according to the semantic association approach. A weakness of this study is that only a semantic association approach was utilized – there are many other curriculums available to DHH children. There is nothing in this study that allows for a strong comparison between semantic association and other learning platforms.<br />

Action research. Chen explores the relationship of phonological awareness and reading ability in children that are DHH – with the notable difference being that Chen studies the impact phonological awareness has in DHH children with it pertains to the Chinese language. Chen admits that there is dichotomy between two schools of thought – that there is either no impact phonological awareness has on readers, and that the impact is great. The results of Chen’s study indicate that there is a significant impact phonological awareness has on children that have DHH – even with variables accounted for such as different hearing aids. This study indicates that the phonological instruction can be developed to aid in the learning of languages with such difficulties as Chinese, where intonation is split into three tones – one same word on paper said in a different tone can have three different meanings. The findings indicate a strength of the study; the ability to transfer phonological knowledge implies increased universality for children with DHH and even with children without DHH disabilities. A weakness of the study would be that the study was conducted with only a small portion of students, meaning that there was a relatively small sample of learners for this particular study.<br />

Action research, quantitative. Goldberg and Lederberg seek to further study the effects of phonological awareness on children’s abilities to read. Like Chen, Goldberg and Lederberg also note the widening dichotomy of the types of thought relating to the efficacy of phonological awareness and its impact on reading. This study instead looks to the impact various components of phonological awareness has on learners as well as studying the patterns of learning of DHH children to identify name-cued letter sound learning. Findings include that letter names are twice as likely to be identified as letter sounds for DHH children, which indicate a pattern of underperformance for DHH children. Another finding indicates that as a result of a lack of phonological ability, DHH children are much more likely to utilize kinesthetic and visual cues to supplement phonological awareness. (Goldberg &amp; Lederberg, 2014) A strength to this study is that patterns of phonological development in DHH is thoroughly established, but the weakness is that a strong enough conclusion relating to the data cannot be established.<br />

Mixed methods, action research. Luckner and Handley seek to understand and comprehend the pattern of effectiveness of the variety of teaching methods employed to children that are DHH. The study comprised of a 42 span of research from peer reviewed journals to make a table of statistically significant methods for teaching children that are DHH. The studies have found five elements that have been identified for at least a tentatively based science approach to reading. Luckner admits there are other methods of teaching to DHH children that do not utilize a phonological approach to reading – with minimal success. Exploring the variety of other options in light of phonological comprehension, Luckner says that the modifications to phonological comprehension to address the remedial issues of the child are also possible. A strength to this study is that it is a comprehensive mixed methods approach. It utilizes the best of quantitative and qualitative studies and structures them into a table of data. A weakness of this data is that there is no statistically significant data to indicate one method of instruction is superior over the other.<br />

Mixed methods, action research. Luckner and Cooke create a synthesis of data to examine the relationships between children that are DHH, their reduced capacity for word knowledge lexicon, and the teaching methods employed to reduce the impact that being DHH has for a child, as there is a significant lack of scientifically driven data as to which reading instruction has statistically significant data for children that are DHH. The results are that Luckner and Cooke notice a lack of systematic inquiry within the set of studies that provide intervention for the children with DHH. The interventions are also not utilized in a variety of other samples of groups. Luckner and Cooke also notes that the amount of statistically significant impact the positive interventions have had are considered small by the U.S. Department of Education. A strength of the study is that they use a national standard of statistically significant thresholds to indicate whether or not a study has impact. A weakness of this study is that it is only a synthesis of the data that already exists.<br />

Mixed methods action research. Narr synthesizes information from anecdotal and empirical sources in order to provide teachers and educators a deeper understanding of the issues relating to DHH children as well as teaching methods to employ to develop phonological awareness. Various strategies are suggested developed around the utilization of phonological awareness, quoting from various sources. Use of tactile/kinesthetic cues to make up for the deficiencies are suggested. Auditory cues are also suggested, for those that have residual hearing. A strength of this study is that it draws from various sources to make suggestions to educators. A weakness of this study is that it employs from anecdotal evidence in a few places. Anecdotal sources are in themselves not necessarily a weakness, but there is a perception of anecdotal evidence being limited in scope.<br />

Quantitative action research. Scott et al. provide research to determine whether or not early intervention practices for children that are DHH has a positive impact on the child’s ability to read. The catalyst for this research was that there was very little data and research regarding early intervention practices for DHH children whereas ample amount of information exists for children that are hearing. In this study children that are DHH are cross examined with children that are of normal hearing. In this study, identification of words and letters, phonological awareness, and vocabulary and whether or not schooling results in a positive impact for children. The results are that the effects are significant for even with children as early as 3 years old. The longitudinal study consisted of over three years with biannual testing. In all three aspects growth was noted, with an exception that vocabulary growth tending to drop off after the second year of schooling intervention. A strength of this analysis is that it is a mixed research approach that presents quantified information. A weakness of this approach is that the study is generalized. There is no definite data that indicates specifically what type of intervention results in the increased ability to read, only that the intervention does indeed result in a positive impact for children as well as children that are DHH.<br />

Quantitative. Trezek seeks to understand the relationship between two of the five reading skills, phonemic awareness and phonics skills and reading comprehension in young children that are DHH. The study utilizes two reading curriculums, Reading Mastery I and Visual phonics, with the research question exploring if the curriculum being administered for one year, can quantitatively indicate an improvement in reading comprehension and word decoding? The research indicates that the original hypothesis being proved valid. That is, that the mean posttest score for the students being administered the curriculum being higher than the pretest. Also, testing through the Word Reading subtests indicates a statistically significant change. A strength of this study is that a specific curriculum was utilized, allowing for greater validity for the study to be replicated. A weakness of this curriculum was that a control group was not utilized. Furthermore, there was a lack of comparison from the curriculum used and other similar curriculums that are designed for children that are DHH.<br />

Quantitative research. Trezek et al. seek to further expand on the existing data of the curriculum Visual Phonics to indicate whether or not it has significance of impact on kindergarten and first grade children that are DHH. Visual phonics was used as a supplement to the curriculum in addition to what was being taught to the children that are DHH. One year of instruction was given to the kindergarten and first graders. The results indicate a statistically significant increase in post test scores. This study is in line with previous studies relating to the Visual Phonics program. Previous studies also indicate a larger increase in pretest and posttest abilities of the learners after one year of implementation of the curriculum. A strength of this study is that it seeks to build on the understanding of previous studies relating to the Visual Phonics program. A weakness the study is that there was no comparison group available for control in this study.<br />

The Effectiveness of a Phonics-Based Early Intervention for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Preschool Children and Its Possible Impact on Reading Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study. American Annals of the Deaf, 158(2), 107-120. doi:10.1353/aad.2013.0021<br />
Mixed methods. A research study was conducted to discover if a 40-50-week intervention would result in an increase of scores for kindergarteners and first graders and to also discover if those results would subsist throughout school. Improvement was noted in all three of the students, despite the differences in difficulty of hearing among the three students, with the ability to sustain and improve those skills. Also, to note was a significant amount of avoidance behavior when intervention first occurred in relationship to sound-based tasks. This should be understandable as the DHH child has had a history of negative experiences of being unable to perform tasks due to his or her reading ability. A strength to this is that because only three children were utilized in the study, the researchers and educators were able to focus their attention entirely on the three children to increase reading ability. But this same strength is also a weakness. There were only three children so there was no ability for generalized implications to a greater population.<br />
Research Problem Statement<br />
Research is conducted to determine whether phonetic based learning contributes directly to the increased ability of a child with DHH to read. DHH children are most certainly underprivileged regarding the lack of options to learn reading ability, as most of learning to read is acquired naturally through phonological awareness that children with normal hearing can utilize. The studies indicate a trend towards the ability to overcome the challenges of a child that is DHH by utilizing the same phonological awareness through creative means. A curriculum that emphasizes phonological awareness shows quantitative impact. Yet, there is no targeted curriculum that utilizes phonological based curriculums for specifically children that are DHH.<br />
Relation of Research Problem to Professional Setting<br />
I want to start a child care with the emphasis on reading, which is why I am enrolled in WGU. Of the children that enter my child care center, I may encounter a few children that have DHH obstacles. It is encouraging to know that the fundamentals are still the same: children acquire phonological awareness naturally. DHH children can also acquire that skill, if there are methods utilized to work around the obstacles they face in relation to their hearing.<br />
Benefits of the Literature Search and Annotated Bibliography<br />
The benefit to this is that I am able to search for numerous articles of quality that relate to my research topic. A literature search allows me to begin to compile necessary information to make a correct judgement of a topic I am exploring. Annotated bibliographies allow me to organize the information that I’ve compiled into a logical format that gives me a short and brief conclusion of each of the research studies that I have employed in my research topic.</p>
