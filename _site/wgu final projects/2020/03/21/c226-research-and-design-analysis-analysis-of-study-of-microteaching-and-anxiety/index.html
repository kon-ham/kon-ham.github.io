  <p>BFP2: Task 2<br />
Kon Ham<br />
06JUL19</p>

<p>A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College<br />
of Western Governors University</p>

<p>Research Purpose and Research Questions<br />
The purpose of this research was to understand the relationship between expanded microteaching and the teacher’s teaching anxiety. (Peker, 2009) The research question is as follows: “Does expanded microteaching have an effect in reducing teaching anxiety about mathematics?” (2009)<br />
Alignment of Research Purpose and Questions<br />
Peker develops a scale called the MATAS (Mathematics Teaching Anxiety Scale) which determines the total amount of anxiety a respondent can feel. MATAS is based on the Likert scale which respondents can rate from 1-5. Pre and post surveys were included to determine a difference or change in the effect of microteaching. This establishes a relationship of alignment between the level of anxiety a pre-service teacher feels before and after the microteaching experience.<br />
Literature Review and Sources Support of Research Purpose and Questions<br />
Peker states that there is a problem relating to teachers and teaching anxiety – specifically for when teaching mathematics. Peker continues to say that these may be a result of past school experiences, perhaps as a student, and the effect that other teachers may have had on the students who are now teachers. (Peker, 2009) Many of these teachers exhibit similar past experiences. Some of them relate to a lack of family support and test anxiety, despite past negative experiences, many of these teachers still want to teach to students. (2009) Peker utilizes a definition of teaching anxiety of Gardner and Leak (1994) that it is “anxiety experienced in relation to teaching activities that involve the preparation and execution of classroom activities.” (2009) In relation to teaching anxiety and mathematics, it is the anxiety that occurs “during teaching mathematical concepts, theories, and formulas or during problem solving” (2009)<br />
Microteaching is the teaching and evaluation in which “a short, but complete, lesson is conducted”. (2009) In this environment, it is usually a small group of teachers that are acting as students. The trainee teacher teaches for 5-10 minutes and is recorded. After the teacher is recorded and the short lecture has ended, the teachers and the trainee teacher him or herself will also evaluate the video and make constructive criticisms of the overall lecture. (2009) This process is then repeated again to a new group of students, or teachers presenting themselves as students. According to Peker, this process of teaching provides the following benefits: first, teachers get a first hand glance what it is like to teach. Secondly, it allows trainee teachers to become more comfortable in their role as a teacher, thirdly, they are able to learn to plan their lecture and the implementation of the lecture, fourthly, they are able to improve their teaching skills, and finally, they are able to build confidence. (2009) According to Peker, the following are the drawbacks to microteaching: first, it is an artificial environment, second, 5-10 minutes is not typical of how long instruction actually lasts in a classroom, third, the audience is not a group of teachers but rather students that do not yet know the material, fourth, it does not teach classroom management skills, and finally, students ask different questions than a teacher would. (2009) Despite these drawbacks, Peker finds that there is a statistical significance demonstrated in favor of microteaching. (2009) Peker utilizes a data collection instrument of his own creation, the Mathematical Teaching Anxiety Scale, (MATAS) which collects data from respondents in four categories: content knowledge, self-confidence, attitude, and attitude towards mathematics. (2009) This is a Likert scale response questionnaire. That is, the MATAS is a 5 point Likert scale with 23 question items. Reliability estimate was utilized through Cronbach’s Alpha, with a reliability coefficient of .91. (2009) Due to the low sample amount, Peker utilized a Shapiro-Wilks test applied to Peker’s MATAS test. This test is utilized when there is a small sample acknowledged by researchers – this test allows for statistical significance to be applied to a theoretically larger sample. The results were indicated that the distribution was within normal parameter. (2009) ANCOVA results indicated a statistical significance in favor of microteaching. (2009) Peker explains limitations within his research. One was that the sample was not a random sample from his target population. (2009) Peker describes his research as quasi-experimental. Secondly, he explains that his target population is too small to make large inferences to a greater population. (2009)<br />
Research Method<br />
Although Peker describes his research method as quasi-experimental, his research is indicated through his own comments, that he sought a quantitative method in analyzing the data. He admits that he had not utilized a random sampling but instead that the teachers utilized for the research were volunteers. (2009) In regards to the MATAS, Peker had his sample take a pre-test and then a post test, the post-test happening after the experimental group had taken the microteaching experience. His sample was separated into two groups, 21 (12 females and 9 males) were the experimental group, and 22 (10 females and 12 males) were the control group. His control group utilized the traditional method of teaching, which was to simply conduct a lecture to 9th graders without microteaching nor other verbal or written instruction. The experimental group utilized the microteaching method described in the above literature review. After both the experimental and control group finished their lectures, they were directed to the post-test MATAS.<br />
Appropriateness of Research Method<br />
Because Peker utilized his own data collection instrument, the MATAS, which is a Likert scale-based questionnaire, it is easy to see why he utilized the quantitative data approach. It is easier to determine causal factors through the use of quantitative data. Furthermore, he utilized a reliability test determined through Cronbach’s Alpha, since the MATAS was a test Peker created on his own. Furthermore, to offset Peker’s small research sample, he utilized a Shapiro-Wilk test to test for normality. (2009) Because he is attempting to determine a casual relationship of the independent variable, microteaching, he utilizes a quantitative approach to determine the total number or mean difference between how the sample felt before microteaching, and after. Since Peker does admit that the research method was quasi-experimental due to the lack of random sampling, he does utilize the Shapiro-Wilk to account for his other shortcoming, which is the lack of a large sample size. His shortcomings to a random sample size may have been a result of a lack of resources or time.<br />
Methods of Data Collection<br />
The actual data utilized to determine causal relationship between microteaching and perceived difference in anxiety was extracted through Peker’s own MATAS survey. This utilizes a 5-point Likert scale self-report in which respondents answered 23 items divided into four categories: content knowledge, self-confidence, attitude towards mathematics teaching, and teaching knowledge. This method was then tested for reliability utilizing Cronbach’s Alpha, with a resulting reliability coefficient rating of 0.91. Finally, Peker utilizes the Shapiro-Wilks to test for normality due to the small sample size. (2009) The maximum score on Peker’s MATAS is 115, and the lowest is 23. (2009) Total points were used to determine anxiety levels, so lower is low anxiety. The mean was determined from the total of both the groups, control and experimental, and they were used to compare with the post-test results to indicate whether or not the mean score had fallen after the use of microteaching, which means there is a lower self-perception of anxiety.<br />
Alignment of Data Collection Methods and Research Purpose and Questions<br />
Because the research questions are attempting to investigate the relationship between microteaching and anxiety levels, the quantitative data approach was appropriate for determining the research question. The MATAS specifically asks questions relating to teaching, anxiety, and mathematics knowledge, which the research question seeks to determine the relationships of. The MATAS then allows for Peker to have data of the mean responses of the sample. With the mean average of pre-test and post-test for both the experimental and control group, Peker can then compare the scores to determine if the microteaching had an effect in lowering the overall mean score of the experimental group. While reliability was tested with Cronbach’s Alpha and normality was tested with Shapiro-Wilks, there did not appear to be an indicator if the researcher tested for validity.<br />
Data Analysis Techniques<br />
Peker takes the mean data from the sum of the total possible score of each respondent and compares the pre-test and post-test scores to determine if there was a change in perceived anxiety. This score was also tested for normality utilizing the Shapiro-Wilks test, which states that if p &gt; 0.05, then the results are normally skewed. Peker utilizes this approach because he admits that his sample size is small, and later discusses in his research paper that the small sample size was one limitation resulting from his research. In this case, Peker’s mean score resulted in a .363 &gt; .05, which indicates that indeed, the results are normally skewed. Secondly, Peker analyzed the data using ANCOVA, or a one-way analysis of the covariance. (2009) This is utilized to minimize the effect of variances between the dependent variable and other potential factors that may skew the tests. ANCOVA helps to “adjust the post-test scores statistically to compensate for the [3-point] difference between the two groups.” (2009) ANCOVA helps to determine and adjust for more accurate results. (2009)<br />
Results of the Study in Relation to Research Questions<br />
The mean score of the experimental group was M=41.667 and M=42.636 was for the control group. These were pre-test readings. The post-test readings are as follows: The experimental group was M=36.523 and the control group was M=40.274. The ANCOVA adjusted for the differences and found that the results were statistically significant in favor of microteaching. (2009)<br />
Research Findings Evaluation<br />
Though no specific methods were mentioned to indicate validity of Peker’s MATAS, Peker does mention the subcategories of the test to indicate what exactly the MATAS measured, but we do not have an overall list of the test items. He admits that because his sample was not random but rather were a group of teacher volunteers. He also indicates that this is not entirely uncommon for the teaching field due to practical reasons. Reliability was effectively tested for and he also accounts for his small sample size by utilizing Shapiro-Wilks test. Finally, he utilizes the ANCOVA analysis to minimize the overall number of other factors that may have caused the difference in the spread of the pre-test and post-test. Overall the findings indicate that the mean score of the MATAS was lower after the intervention of microteaching, compared to the control group in which teachers essentially began teaching right away to a group of 9th graders.</p>
