  <p>The title of this book is misleading. The majority of people reading this book may hope to glean a quick list of seven principles that they can implement into their lives immediately. You cannot.</p>

<p>The best way to frame the seven “habits” listed out by Stephen R. Covey is that they are instead seven things most people will never do in their lives. For example, Habit 5: “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”</p>

<p>How many of us are actually listening and attempting to empathize with our dear and loved ones? My guess is that the majority of you are not listening at all, but merely waiting for your turn to speak.</p>

<p>All throughout our lives we are taught to wait before speaking as if merely the act of waiting before speaking was the virtue in itself. The lesson is entirely lost then when you’re not actively listening and non-judgmentally listening to your loved ones.</p>

<p>Too quick are we to respond with advice or tough love or with well-meaning feelings.</p>

<p>Too slow (if we ever get there) are we to listen, and accept what was said.</p>

<p>It takes courage to implement such a mode of listening, because in such a mode Covey says you become receptive and open to impression through this mode of listening. Meaning, an active listening process involves opening yourself up completely to that person’s thoughts and feelings. How terrifying that is for most people. How terrifying that is to me.</p>

<p>This book is not a list of seven habits. It is a list of seven things most people will never do because they lack the courage to face the world and to be a sincere individual – sincere to ones own self and sincere to the needs of others.</p>

<p>Understandably most people cannot reach this level – life already has so many pitfalls, concerns, and problems in itself that most people have a hard time keeping their own lives pieced together, let along having genuine unselfish care for others.</p>

<p>“7 Habits” taunts us with the maddening idea that being true to ourselves and to others, though in the short term costs much more in time and effort, will pay infinitely greater in the long term. It is the ultimate view of the middle-class; to be entirely future oriented in how we navigate ourselves and others.</p>

<p>This book was frustrating for me to read, and yet had such a blessed hope for the future. I know myself that I’ve failed many times to be a person with genuine desire for others. Simply to try to understand others first is such a giant challenge to me.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Read this book if you want to know exactly what you are not doing in your life and what the wonderful possibilities could be if you made just one step in the direction of sincerity, compassion, and love.</p>
