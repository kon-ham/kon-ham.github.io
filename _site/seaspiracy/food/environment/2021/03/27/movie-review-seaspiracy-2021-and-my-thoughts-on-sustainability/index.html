This documentary has broken my heart. It is also a very good documentary.</p>

<p>I’m beginning to think that there is no such thing as sustainability.</p>

<p>As populations begin to grow, there is no capability in which man can continually consume at the same rate without consequences.</p>

<p>When we eat meat, we must acknowledge the fact that in order for us to eat, a thing gave up its life for us. The modern industrial complex that gives us such wonderful blessings such as cheap meat has also been in some ways, a spendthrift to us. It has become an industry that is out of control. We as humans have forgotten to be watchful of the things given to us to be responsible for.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the answers are, but I think that at the very minimum, today, when we begin to eat, we also take a moment to sit, be thankful, and acknowledge that sacrifices were made so that we could enjoy our meal.</p>
