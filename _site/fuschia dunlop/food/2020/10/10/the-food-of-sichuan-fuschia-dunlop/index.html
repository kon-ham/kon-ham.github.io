  <p>Allow me to preface this review by saying that I love spicy food. I am a masochist for it.</p>

<p>But from my limited experience of Sichuan cuisine, the spice in the food is not overwhelming at all. It is mostly a mild spice that is very sophisticated in its approach to how the spice coats your tongue.</p>

<p>This spice is often referred to as a certain kind of a zing or tingle. The tingle comes from the Sichuan peppercorns, which are not actually peppercorns at all but are more related to the citrus family.</p>

<p>I purchased this book because if anything, I want to be a familiar neighbor of Sichuan cuisine. One day I will have to go to Chengdu to learn more. Sichuan cuisine has been unusually closed off to Western appetites in that the ingredients can be difficult to find and because the average Westerner looks for what might be known as American Chinese food, so the demand is simply not there for Sichuan cuisine. Sichuan cuisine could be considered a culinary secret.</p>

<p>Watching Fuschia talk about her background and her passion for the Sichuan style of cooking has been wonderful. She speaks the language and was the first Westerner to graduate from Sichuan’s most prestigious culinary institute. She knows her stuff not simply because of her enrollment and graduation of an elite culinary school that was once entirely closed off to foreigners, but because it is plain as day how much she loves the culture. She appears to speak fluently the Chinese language.</p>

<p>The book itself is a beautiful book. I paid $30 for the book. It is probably one of the most beautiful books I own. A reviewer on Amazon said that the book reads like a novel instead of a traditional cookbook. I found this to be true.</p>

<p>Fuschia mentioned in one of her interviews Chinese cooking in general is very healthy and that the West could learn from its example. I agree. Typically this cuisine is heavy in vegetables and lighter on the meat – yet there is no feeling of lack found in Chinese cuisine that there would be in American if there were not a large chunk of meat on each plate. She calls this sustainable, I call it genius. I don’t care to limit anyone’s desire to eat more meat. More power to you. But for me, if I could, I would like to eat a ratio of 70% vegetables and 30% meat. This is completely possible with Chinese cuisine.</p>

<p>The directions for each recipe are clear and concise. The words don’t meander about. For ages I tried my best to look for Sichuan cooking – most of the recipes and directions felt esoteric and vague. Not this book. I think this book stands for me the best shot I have at understanding the Sichuan cuisine. Maybe one day I’ll be an authority on such a beautiful palate of flavor and sophistication. Who would have thought from such an old civilization that besides paper and gunpowder that these people would also have pioneered the art of flavor?</p>
