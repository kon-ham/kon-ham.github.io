  <p>Reference is the video, forget watching the video. The essence of this video is summed up by the comment of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw6FJoMnDkltL_EExs1tp5Q">Jeremiah Cuarteros</a>.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>these gaming moments teach us important, CRUCIAL LESSONS in life :
The Fountain Hooks – tells us to think out of the box, utilize unforeseen circumstances to turn the tide and grasp victory
The Mega Creep Comeback – never EVER freaking give up no matter how grim or hopeless the situation is The Deny – one &gt;small mistake can create disastrous results that will echo up to the future generations.
The Six Million Dollar Echo Slam – speaking of echo, this teaches us to take advantage of sudden opportunities then ensure &gt;victory by cooperating with others s4’s
Million Dollar Dream Coils – time is of the essence. hesitate or be slow in response and the chance to get it will get away and be lost forever and you will never have another chance to claim the win
BuLba and Clockwerk – never underestimate your opponent. your teammtates, or even your self. you dont even know how powerful you are until you rest everything on the line. you are a monster deep inside.
BELIEVE IN THAT! the play – always, ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED. it is better to have trained for things that would probably never happen than never have trained for things that could possibly go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

  <li>
    <p>Creativity means a willingness to try a different approach. Creativity with a solid foundation of skills allows for unexpected opportunity. Creativity without foundational skills is simply throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. Big difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tenacity of hope is what makes or breaks battles. A person that is cynical for the future will never be a leader with lasting generational impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes as you chip away at your work you will begin to see other opportunities. Most of these opportunities arise as you are working into developing your field. They don’t arise as you sit in bed and ponder all day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quoting a Florida real-estate investment expert Jim Napier, “When someone puts a million dollars in your hand, close your hand.” When the going is good, run with it and don’t look back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The potential for greatness exists in all of us, just waiting to be harvested. The acre of diamonds is in your backyard. Therefore, since the same potential for greatness is in you as it is in others, never underestimate others, as this could be your undoing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am typically critical of sports fanaticism. I have no problem with moderate viewing, but most people do not view moderately. Most people view religiously.</p>

<p>If you can get a lesson from watching a quick sport clip then utilize the takeaway and then, walk away. Don’t waste your time fawning over men and women who will never know you exist.</p>
