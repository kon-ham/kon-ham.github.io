Provide a Description of the Selected Article and Issue&lt;br /&gt;
A. Provide a Brief Summary of the Article&lt;br /&gt;
Tumblr, a social media blogging platform has recently imposed a site-wide ban on pornography. The author explains that the original issue of the site wide ban was due to the child pornography that was being distributed on Tumblr. Continuing, the author says that while the issue of child pornography is a very serious one to consider, the author states that the ban resulted in an unintended effect, that is the marginalizing of L.G.B.T.Q members. The author gives anecdotal accounts of individuals that would not have know they were gay if it hadn’t been for Tumblr’s pornography and social media community. The author states that the ban was reactionary and that better ways could have been implemented to protect L.G.B.T.Q individuals while still abolishing the distribution of child pornography while contemplating the heavy handed approach of Tumblr’s decision.&lt;br /&gt;
Provide a Brief Description of the Issue&lt;br /&gt;
The issue is whether or not media has an effect on gender identity and sexual development. Tumblr imposed the pornography ban because of a concern that child pornography was being distributed throughout the site. The author notes that individuals have had their orientation revealed through the consuming of the various types of niche pornography that was on Tumblr. Although the author made no mention of underage users being able to access the site by simply falsifying their profile birthdates, it is very likely that children under the age of 18 had access to this pornography. And this could have had an effect on gender identity and development. There needs to be a determination on whether or not the anecdotal responses of the individuals that the author quotes from have any basis in scientific research. The author does not mention individuals under 18 using the site for pornographic purposes, but considering the ease of ability for an individual to falsify information when creating an account, this also needs to be considered into the overall impact of the site and whether or not the pornographic support group was positive or negative or introduced any sort of change in development at all. Of course the author’s perspective was that the pornography was a net positive for sexual development and gender identity, the author makes no mention the age group of which this sexual development impacted.&lt;br /&gt;
What impact does the issue have on sexual development?&lt;br /&gt;
The impact is that potentially pornographic use or consumption can lead to modification or changes in sexual development and or gender identity in both children and adults. According to the author’s use of anecdotes, certain individuals were able to realize that they might be gay. With such a realization one must consider potential hindsight bias as a logical fallacy, but the potential remains that a person could have discovered his or her real gender identity or another aspect of his or her fluidity of gender identity and sexual development. Can pornographic use change one’s gender identity? Can it affect sexual development? Without the assumption that it can affect development and identity, there is no criticism by the author of the ban implemented by Tumblr.&lt;br /&gt;
What is the stance of the article in terms of the issue being discussed?&lt;br /&gt;
The stance of the author is that pornography found on Tumblr was a net positive for individuals such as L.G.B.T.Q identified people. The author does not disagree with Tumblr in that there was an issue of child pornography being distributed on the site. It is Tumblr’s method in which the author criticizes, continuing that the method, while with good intentions, affects sexual minorities from being able to free share and explore their sexual identities. This stance by the author is that he or she believes that the type of pornography found on Tumblr was an advocate for women and sexual minorities and that such advocacy was a positive influence for such people. Specifically, the author states “…the voices of women and the L.G.B.T.Q. community — who pointed out that this change will destroy a safe space for self-expression, discovery and connection.” (Powell, 2018) Continuing, the author states “When tech companies tackle large-scale problems with large-scale solutions, underrepresented groups are often further marginalized as a result.” (Powell, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Conduct an analysis of current research related to the issue&lt;br /&gt;
Summarize some of the current research related to the topic&lt;br /&gt;
Coleman in her review of Jordan and Romer’s “Media and the Well-being of Children and Adolescents”, makes note of chapter six of Jordan and Romer’s book in that beginning with the premise that “sexual identity is a key component of adolescent development in general” (Coleman, 2014) and that sexual media has been shown to have an effect in “physiological outcomes, attitudinal outcomes, and behavioral outcomes for youth”. (Coleman, 2014) Coleman notes that this is empirically backed data. Though Coleman notes in her review that the outcomes of sexual media consumption on adolescence as a whole is still up for debate, Coleman notes that also up for debate is whether or not sexual media can “provide healthy sexual socialization.” (Coleman, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
McKee in his study of whether or not pornography harms young people has noted that the results are inconclusive and that there is no empirical data to present the conclusion that pornography harms young people. (McKee, 2010) He also notes that pornography is not addictive and that there is no large generational difference in the amount of information a person has about sex. (McKee, 2010) McKee also mentions that due to ethical considerations, there is very little studies done on children as to the effects that pornography might have on children, so he makes note in his studies that most of the information compiled has to do with indirect research, for example mentioning that sex criminals have no more or less frequent use of pornography compared to others. (McKee, 2010)&lt;br /&gt;
How does the research relate to the situation that was described in your selected article?&lt;br /&gt;
The research relates in finding a conclusive answer as to whether or not adolescence in terms of sexual development and gender identity is affected. One research study assumes that pornography can and does have an affect on adolescence as a result of the stage in which adolescence involves key physiological development as well as emotional development, and another study assumes that the research actually indicates that pornography has no negative affects on growing children and adolescents. The author of the New York Times article suggests that L.G.B.T.Q and other sexual minority members are affected by the pornographic ban on Tumblr and the research relates in whether or not children and adolescents are affected by pornography. Tumblr is easily accessible by young adults. The author of the New York Times article suggests that the pornography itself was benign if not beneficial to the sexual development of people. I selected articles to discover if pornography is beneficial or if it has negative affects on a human. Of course, since the author approves of the Tumblr pornography ban because of the resulting distribution of child pornography on the website, her argument would be less effective if it were a known fact that a significant portion of the users of Tumblr were underage children.&lt;br /&gt;
Discuss whether the research is consistent or varies by study.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the difficulties in testing and gathering empirical data on a longitudinal timeframe it is difficult to find conclusive answers to this problem. How will a researcher discover if pornography affects young children if it is unethical to introduce pornography to children? And how will one test the negative or positive effects of pornography while isolating the various other variables that make a person better or worse? The conclusion is that the research is inconsistent for a myriad of reasons. Ethically it is difficult to measure pornography’s effect on children. Secondly, measuring the effect on adults may prove to be difficult to replicate the typical setting in which one consumes the material. Clinical settings are not the typical place one may consider to be an erotic place. Thirdly, surveys also produce limitations due to the questions and the variety of bias a person may have in answering questions truthfully and honestly.&lt;br /&gt;
Based on your review of the research, determine what future research you would propose regarding this topic, and explain your reasoning.&lt;br /&gt;
My opinion on the matter is that future research need not be done concerning the effects of pornography and adolescence. Ethically I cannot think of a way to test for this without eliminating any potential confounding variables while at the same time ethically testing for this on young adults or adolescents. I agree with McKee in that young children express themselves sexually often times through play. My opinion is that sexuality is part of humanity. My only concern is that sexuality would increasingly play a larger portion of the experience of humanity than other experiences. Does defining one’s sexuality and gender identity and exploring that provide deeper meaning and fulfillment in a human being? I would like to propose a test in which scientists discover how important sexuality is in comparison to the other climaxes of human experience. I believe that from there in an indirect way we can ethically discover the impact of pornography on adults and children alike. Finally, the author makes note that not only is the article a matter of whether or not pornography is a positive or a negative on society and that sexual minority groups are marginalized, the author also states that there is a further issue of technological giants being unable to comprehend the complex needs of these people and that the various algorithms the companies use in order to implement the ban are still lacking in many advancements to be able to make appropriate judgement calls like for example, distinguishing child pornography from adult pornography.&lt;br /&gt;
Reflect on the issue’s relevance A, B, C&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that L.G.B.T.Q identity has become a much more pressing topic today. Furthermore, with the advent of technology, it has become much easier for young adults or adolescents or even children to send nude pictures of themselves through the internet. L.G.B.T.Q minorities press the importance of the subject of sexual and gender identity and the oppression by the so-called majority of heterosexual normativity. Legally, a child that willingly sends nude photos of him or herself to a recipient makes that recipient a criminal by law. That person is now legally at risk of being in possession of child pornography. There have been cases in which young boys have been charged with possession of child pornography because their girlfriends had sent them nude photos. On one end of the spectrum the government has increasingly paved legal rights to the L.G.B.T.Q minorities. Understandably the state has begun to listen to the voices of these minorities. What is to me, not very understandable, is the inability of the state to recognize the difference between child pornography and two young children utilizing the tools they have to express sexuality. The New York Times article laments the loss of Tumblr’s sexual minority pornography but there appears to be a loss for words for heterosexual children expressing themselves in that same way the author laments about. As far as technological groups holding the majority of sway in whether or not a sexual minority is able to communicate and to share ideas like niche pornography, the answer is always to decentralize. Tumblr, like the state in its heavy handed approach to handling sexuality by for example, assigning young men and women to felon status and forcing them to enroll in sex offender registries in a vain attempt to protect others from sexual assault and misconduct, has proven once that the state and giant technological companies like Tumblr, that hold an incredible amount of sway on cultural movement is incapable of wielding such a power to handle matters of sexuality with integrity and common sense judgement. No one doubts that sex involves intimacy and therefore a certain kind of power is imbued within it. My thoughts are that the government as well as Tumblr should hold no power over my sexuality and that they have absolutely no right to probe it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
Culture is the mechanism by which we view the world. “As culture is a meaning and information system, it is basically an abstraction that we use to refer to many aspects of our ways of living.” (Matsumoto &amp;amp; Juang, 2017) In this abstraction, or, culture, people hold views based on “values, beliefs, norms, attitudes, and worldviews.” (Matsumoto &amp;amp; Juang, 2017) Put two people together with the intent of having a discussion of an object or topic and you will find that they may likely differ. In this essay I collect the thoughts and values of myself and a counterpart I’ve randomly selected. In this case this is my coworker that I happen to be able to interview for the day. This essay will attempt to draw cultural distinctions between myself and him and to also find similarities between the two cultures in order to more fully understand the depth that culture plays on our understanding of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
I am a 29-year-old Christian Korean-American. I was born in South Korea, Seoul. After about two years of age, my family immigrated to the United States, first touching down to New York City and then moving to St. Louis, Missouri, where I stayed and grew up until the age of 9 or 10. After I completed the fourth grade, my parents moved down to Augusta, Georgia for a year because of my father’s failed attempt at running a Chinese restaurant in St. Louis. We had moved down to Augusta because of some family members on my paternal family’s side was already living there. We only stayed a year because of some issues arising with my mom and my dad’s sisters. We then moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where I spent the majority of my teen and young adult life. At 26 I joined the United States Coast Guard. Finally, I was stationed in Galveston, Texas where I now reside. My parents are still together. I have a younger sister who is 8 years younger than me. My parents were authoritative.&lt;br /&gt;
My counterpart is a 21-year-old man that was born in Alexander City, Alabama. At around two years of age, my counterpart moved three hours south of Alexander City, Alabama in order to be closer to his parent’s home town and family. In Luverne, Alabama, was where my counterpart lived from childhood to the end of middle school. After his parent’s divorce, my counterpart moved to Montgomery, Alabama to live with his father. During this period, he went through five different schools during two years because he was causing trouble in the schools. His father remarried a month after the divorce. He graduated high school at 16 after finally having settled on a military school. He then moved back to Luverne, Alabama to cut grass and to work in chicken grow houses. At 17 he joined the United States Coast Guard and was stationed to Miami Beach, Florida. At 19, he was again stationed to Galveston, Texas. He considers himself to be Agnostic. His father was authoritarian and his mother is what he would describe to be as “friendly”.&lt;br /&gt;
My counterpart and I don’t get to spend much time together because he and I work in two different departments. But occasionally, we spend time together when we both must stand watch duties. Usually this involves staying in a small building together to check identification for the oncoming vehicles. This is usually a 10-hour shift. During this time, we usually pass the time through small talk and sometimes watching YouTube videos. He is usually quiet but I can get him to be talkative if I ask him questions on topics that he has interest in, like for example, bully dogs or raising animals to sell. Today I’ve asked him about his life and his culture in order to complete this project. He says he comes from a poor class and that he grew up with an authoritarian father. After I had asked him a series of questions I asked if he wanted anything from the store and he asked for a can of Copenhagen long cut chewing tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
Enculturation, Development and Cognition, Physical and Mental Health, Communication and Personality, Self-identification and Socialization, and Organizational Processes&lt;br /&gt;
When I asked my counterpart to describe his culture, he used the words “poor” and “strict”. For the concept poor, I’ve discovered that the use of the poor concept is actually a part of social cohesion used by the Appalachia people, which Alabamians make up part of. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) Specifically, the use of the low-class dialect by the Appalachia people being used as a marker and identifier of social cohesion. Historically, the Appalachia’s were difficult to travel though and telephone lines did not come into development in the Appalachia areas until nearly the 1950’s. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) As a result, there was a greater need for dependence upon family, church, and community. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) Furthermore, there was a greater distrust of strangers, “both individuals and organizations”. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) When I asked my counterpart who he would ask for help in a situation of emergency, he said that he would first ask his parents and then to ask his church. Intergroup relations follow through the basis of kinship. My counterpart said to me that whenever he would bring home a girl, his grandfather would ask the girl “Who is your daddy?”. This is a typical attempt at a Southern tradition to further understand a person. (Willima, 1999) And typical of Southerners of the Appalachia, my counterpart described his home as a patriarchal family in which the father makes the important decision and traditional gender roles are supported, as in, the wife cooks and cleans. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) My counterpart tells me of a story of his friend’s father that raised his daughter to bring him beer, in a practice to teach the daughter traditional gender roles. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
I asked my counterpart where morality was taught and he said that he was raised a Baptist. He spent the majority of his young adult life in church. He tells me that there were concepts taught such as heaven and hell and that there were consequences to bad decisions. The Appalachia tradition of religion plays a major role in the development of moral values in the Appalachia people. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) I asked him how he would go about asking for advice on life and career decisions and he told me that he grew up asking his family for advice first. This is not uncommon for his upbringing which holds the family in large regard. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) I asked my counterpart how important politics was for his family. He said that it was nearly irrelevant to his upbringing and family. He said that he almost never talked about politics with family.&lt;br /&gt;
As for me, family was incredibly important to me and there was an upbringing of teaching that involved the mistrust of strangers. My parents came to the United States and our immigration status had expired. We were on the illegal status for quite some time. Because of that, my parents taught me to stay away from authority figures like the police. I also remember going to immigration interviews and standing in line for hours and being treated rudely by immigration officials. All of this led to a distrust of strangers and especially to government officials. My parents also struggled with their concerns of me growing up being a Korean in an American society. Black Americans, along with Korean American parents, report “sharing similar worries.” (Choi, Tan, Hiong, &amp;amp; Pekelnicky, 2014) This concern of racial relations was reported to have been passed on to the children by the parents of those who also have experienced racism. (Choi, Tan, Hiong, &amp;amp; Pekelnicky, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
I experienced my parents telling me that parts of my life were influenced because of direct racism towards me as a Korean living in America. And this may have been in part due to the strong pride of racial identification of being Korean. Korean immigrant parents are known for this pride. (Choi, Tan, Hiong, &amp;amp; Pekelnicky, 2014) My parents also instilled in me a great need for education. This education was, in my parents view, worth the daily sacrifice they made for me every day, I was told. My father wakes up at 3:00AM to go to work and comes home at 7:00PM. He has continued to do this for nearly 15 years. And he makes it known to me that it is for my future success in education that he is willing to do what he does every day. Also, growing up my parents wished me to be as Korean as possible, so they would send me to Korean school on the weekends so that I could improve and maintain my heritage. They felt learning what it meant to be Korean was a good thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;
Similarities&lt;br /&gt;
Both myself and my counterpart have been raised Christian. So moral development and gender roles in this sense have been influenced by a Christian upbringing. Intergroup relations, peer relations, and parenting and family systems have also been influenced by a Christian outlook. Both myself and my counterpart spent significant amounts of time at church and that in both cases, majority of the friendships that were established were first originated in the church. For my counterpart, his extended family or kin was in the church and for me, a place to meet other Koreans that had immigrated to the United States. We also both have had upbringings where gender roles were conservative and heavily emphasized. We both also had a patriarchal family structure where the father made the majority of the decisions. The emphasis on family was great for the both of us. Advice about life and problems concerning life were always first addressed with the family. Also, the distrust of strangers and foreigners is common to both of us. Where my counterpart would have a mistrust towards government agencies and newcomers, so would my cultural upbringing also have the same mistrust towards government agencies and strangers. And because both of our cultures had a mistrust of strangers, we’ve both had to rely more heavily upon the family, peers, and the church for problems larger than ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
Although his culture of separation of others comes from a lack of ability to travel through the regional areas of Appalachia without great effort, I experienced a similar form of extreme inclusion of my culture by my physical differences as well as my cultural and language differences with other Americans that was similar to the geographical isolation of the Appalachia region. There is some form of discrimination experienced by the both of us as a result of regional differences. His is that he is sometimes ridiculed for having a Southern accent and he reports that others assume he is dumb because he talks slowly. This stereotype of Southerners having lowered intellectual ability as a result of merely being Southern and speaking with an accent is similar to what I’ve experienced as a Korean American, except that instead of assuming I am dumb, the stereotype impression of being Korean or Asian is that I am smart or that I am good at math. Filial relationships are highly emphasized and sacrifices are expected if it comes between work and education or personal success and family. My counterpart tells me that his family comes first and that such an expectation is held by all members of the family. I also have a similar context of family. I know that because my parents had sacrificed much to bring me to where I am now, that I am also to do the same for them when they grow older, and the same sacrifice to be made to my sister by me. The distrust of governmental forces comes from both of our historical events. My counterpart shares his experiences from the past American Civil War of federal government intrusion into the lives of the Southern people. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007) For me, my father grew up during the military dictatorship of South Korea. (Min, 2013) My parents grew up in Korea during this time and had experienced many hardships as a result of the military government.&lt;br /&gt;
Differences&lt;br /&gt;
I have an experience unique to my counterpart in that I am perceived to be a foreigner in the U.S despite having been here since I was brought to this country by my parents at the age of 2. My counterpart knows his hometown, has been to it, and there is no question by others as to the authenticity of his culture. Korean Americans can share a similar experience in that in the United States their “Korean-ness” is never questioned except by those that grew up in Korea. (Min, 2013) My counterpart has not had a struggle to learn two separate cultures in an attempt to mix them together. He has one culture and it blends into his larger perspective of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
He is currently now, no longer Christian. He says that he is probably more Buddhist than he is Christian now. According to Buddhism, there is no God and there are no absolutes. (The Buddhist Centre, 2018) According to Christianity, there are absolutes. God being one absolute, and the concept of sin that has corrupted humanity being the second absolute. This leads to a wide difference between him and I.&lt;br /&gt;
He does not recall his parents being worried for him because he was a racial minority. I on the other hand, have vivid memories of my parents being upset with the other children or with events that have had a negative effect on my life because of a result of what my parents felt were discriminatory behavior due to race. There is also a difference in the sense of association with Korean people that I feel when I see another person that I can identify to be Korean. There is a feeling of kinship merely based on the fact that he or she is Korean. I asked my counterpart if he feels the same way about Alabamians but he said that he did not, but he would feel there was a closer sense of connection if that person had also lived in regions and towns that he had also lived in, or if he knew friends and family related to my counterpart, which aligns with the study of Appalachia mentality of peers and family. (Tang &amp;amp; Russ, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
There is also some difference in the relationship of education and family. My counterpart tells me that if it came down to it, he would choose family over an education and that this would be considered an acceptable choice by his family. For my family this would not be acceptable as my parents consider the work they do in order to earn money to pay for my education would all be considered a loss if I were to choose family over an education. So, there would be pressure from my parents to choose an education over family matters because education is highly emphasized in Korean culture. (Min, 2013) My counterpart also has no experience in the pressure to choose an ethnic group identification like I have.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I asked my counterpart what he would do if there were a problem that had to be addressed and he said that he would address the issue as soon as possible in order to avoid misunderstandings. For Asian Americans, specifically Korean Americans, there appears to be a correlation with being Korean and a high level of internalization of problems, which presents Korean-Americans or Asians at a higher risk for suicide than other ethnic minority groups. (Choi, Tan, Hiong, &amp;amp; Pekelnicky, 2014) I was taught that I should avoid problems and that discussing them could lead to more problems.&lt;br /&gt;
Between myself and my counterpart I found that there were more similarities than dissimilarities, most of those dissimilarities having to do relating to race and immigration. We both have a very defined perspective of what an insider is and what an outsider is and both the outlooks on life are fundamentally Christian, though my counterpart no longer believes in a form of a Christian God, and the view of family as being of supreme importance is similar between us. The author wonders if it’s the element of Christianity that leads to much similarities between us two but that is the topic for another conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is in trouble. We have many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question is whether or not you believe that we’ve run out of the means to solve our problems. Have we run out of steam? Are we out of creative juice and technological momentum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-we-running-on-empty-determining-yes-or-no-would-make-you-either-an-optimist-or-a-pessimist&quot;&gt;Are we running on empty? Determining yes or no would make you either an optimist or a pessimist.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking perfection is poison. Perfect doesn’t even exist in nature. Rather, in nature things just are the way they are and there is no insecurity about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-can-learn-from-this&quot;&gt;We can learn from this.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distracted writing doesn’t work. Being in an eerie feeling of silence, isolation and anxiety is a better environment for writing than distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-probably-goes-for-any-high-skill-knowledge-as-well&quot;&gt;This probably goes for any high-skill knowledge as well.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do say “no”, simply say “no, I can’t/won’t” without apology or follow up. You don’t have to explain yourself nor attempt to fill the silence with noise.
———-
For friends it’s better to say “no” more often than you say “yes”, so that when you do say “yes” you can “yes” generously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-are-a-guilt-ridden-people-and-we-tend-to-say-yes-out-of-guilt-rather-than-out-of-generosity&quot;&gt;We are a guilt-ridden people and we tend to say yes out of guilt rather than out of generosity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting down on your social obligations will result in disappointing others. But your level of freedom will increase accordingly. But will this make you happier?
———-
I can’t help but wonder if when someone says they are bored that they are in fact, depressed.
———-
It is possible to drown someone with too much support. Sometimes it’s best give people space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-takes-learned-experience-to-know-to-discern-between-the-two&quot;&gt;It takes learned experience to know to discern between the two.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building trust takes ages. Losing trust takes one second.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Future of School and Society</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/schooling/society/education/2021/07/09/future-of-school-and-society/"/>
   <updated>2021-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/schooling/society/education/2021/07/09/future-of-school-and-society</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A child can finish a K-12 curriculum through Khan Academy for $0.00. It will probably take 4-8 years, depending on innate aptitude and assuming the average student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are making a mistake if you believe that more schooling will result in competitive populations for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we will have young people finish a basic education in 4-6 years and will have the rest of their free-time to develop meaningful experiences that will blossom one day into solving many of our great problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of them will become the next great explorers, entrepreneurs, writers, singers, dancers, artists…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those young people will at 12-14 begin collegiate level academics. We will have a new generation of scientists and engineers that think asymmetrically and creatively because we as a society don’t funnel our young people into brick and mortar schools that encourage only one way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the great crises we face now will slip away into the dark because we unleash the power of common ingenuity of regular people that are given an opportunity to dream big. (BTW, public schooling discourages dreaming big)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest gift we can give our young people and the next generation is the gift of greater and increased opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do this by savagely trimming away the fat that is the total number of years children and young people spend in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common for young people to graduate even college without a clue of what they want to do to contribute to our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we blame them? We stick them in white cinderblock buildings for over 15,000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thoughts As A Fresh EMT-B Grad</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/emt-b/drowning/drinking/holiday/guns/safety/4th%20of%20july/2021/07/07/thoughts-as-a-fresh-emt-grad/"/>
   <updated>2021-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/emt-b/drowning/drinking/holiday/guns/safety/4th%20of%20july/2021/07/07/thoughts-as-a-fresh-emt-grad</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By the time I graduated EMT school, I learned there was a million and one ways to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips from an EMT newbie that might save your life or the life of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to the beach you’ve never been to before, understand that you are at danger of drowning. You do not know the water. Do not disrespect the sea. The sea has an excellent record of taking lives. It is the equivalent of running with scissors. You may drown. Know riptides can end your life quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to nearly drown in sea water but manage to survive, go to the hospital anyways in case you dry drown. (The salt crystals in your lungs can cause you to foam and drown even if you’re not under water). Being under supervision overnight at the hospital may save your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel good after drinking, you’re definitely drunk and you need to watch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that everyone carries a gun. This means that you should not raise your voice at anyone that’s been out under the hot sun all day like you have been. There is a strong correlation with hot weather and violence. This means if you’ve been drinking shut your mouth if you’re not around people you know and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a drunk person, try your best to both mind your own business and also try to make sure that person is taken care of. Not all drunk looking people are drunk. Some of them are exhibiting drunk behaviors because they are diabetic despite not having touched an ounce of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also assume everyone is driving drunk. This is called defensive driving. Do not assume people know what they are doing when it comes to driving. A vehicle can be a means to end a person’s life. Watch yourself and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, enjoy but don’t enjoy at the expense of your life. Your life is too short to make a silly mistake that causes your loved ones to grieve over you. Enjoy this 4th of July in moderation and be thankful for this wonderful land of ours. The grass is still green and it still rains (in some parts). We can be thankful for such a beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, try to keep your house looking busy. You go on vacation, naughty people go to work at your house. If you can, start getting to know your neighbors and ask they watch over your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if an unfortunate situation happens and you are in a position to potential help someone, you must ALWAYS ask yourself – IS THIS SITUATION SAFE. If it is not, you must not proceed. One life is already a tragedy. Do not proceed if the situation is not safe. You cannot help others if you yourself are not safe. Never disregard this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy 4th of July, and may you all live long and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://getpoole.com/writing/patience/forgiveness/rest/worklife%20balance/boundaries/joel%20salatin/michael%20c.%20pollan/omnivore's%20dilemma/creative%20desert/linkedin/travel/story%20telling/dating%20sites/danny%20trejo/honesty/salesmanship/illiteracy/advocacy/income%20share%20agreements/hyundai/advertising/2021/07/07/linkedin-posts-pt-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of posts from people that say they are open to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they hardly post anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of life is being OK with rejection. Not everyone will like your thoughts. However, it is probably best you do a favor to everyone else to make it very easy and quick to say “no” to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be willing to share your thoughts, even if you feel they are immature. We will debate those thoughts on the open theatre. Not everyone is right. It is OK to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need more people willing to share their opinions and deeply held convictions in the right context. (reading: Six Thinking Hats – Dr. Edward de Bono)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be willing to share in humility and love for your fellow humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our problem now is that we have sterility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to share our thoughts more and open the proverbial can of worms. We need more discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be patient with others. I have a friend that has allowed a leech into her life. It drives me up to the wall to hear her complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always try you best to be patient. And it’s probably best you say very little. Even if you think you have a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ll try to take my own advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is too short to have enemies. Forgive and move on. You don’t have to best buddies with everyone. You can limit contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But always be willing to forgive and remember that you could be an enemy to someone else. Humility is a big takeaway here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have one day of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days of rest might be a problem because you start to forget quicker than you might think and it takes effort to get the ball rolling again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day of rest allows for creative inspiration and, reminds you that work is not all there is to your existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you rest you should remember the people that brought you into this world, the ones that helped you to become what you are now, and to also forgive your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if you do not forgive you only continue to poison yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unemployed so take my advice with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be willing to say “no” more often than you are willing to say “yes”. This applies to most all situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier to get into something than it is to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definitely applies to purchasing a vehicle at a stealer- I mean, dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need people to apply a Joel Salatin approach to the professional world. For reference, check out Michael C. Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a professional world of sterility that as a whole, creates a weaker species that is prone to sickness. Having biodiversity in terms of germs and microorganisms allows for a stronger species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of sterility we have in the professional workplace leads only to one product – one that is weak from outside attack, artificial, and can only exist in a system that is entirely dependent on subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage specialization and diversity that is appropriate to your climate and region. You will produce better crops that have higher nutritional content. Happier livestock also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is a creative desert and a poor representation of the potential of the depths of the human experience – especially as a business professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile LinkedIn prospers off of our creative and spiritual starvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching a TV show about traveling. Hosts go to Bali. They are trying to convey that cheap yet value locations can be had for those that look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true. You can travel for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for most people, while cash is a priority, the biggest cost for people is opportunity. People have to put in vacation days (if you are privileged to have vacation days) in order to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost of cash is secondary. First is opportunity cost. Most Americans, despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world in comparison to other nations, cannot afford to travel because of the opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s an opportunity in building a media company that specializes in story telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing loads of movies being rehashed lately makes me think that we may be close to being creatively bankrupt. This is not to say that good movies aren’t been made. I’m saying that the frequency of good movies being made lately seems to have dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People need stories to inspire and uplift themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve watched certain Disney movies as a child you can remember the emotional impact those movies made on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about Lion King? Pinocchio? Land Before Time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the news of Amazon purchasing MGM, I’m led to believe that there is an opportunity for those that want to create a small media company that can take advantage of current technologies to create and deliver high quality and impactful stories. Using CGI technologies like Blender (which is open source and a beautiful example of the quality open source projects can demonstrate) and utilizing cloud storage services like AWS could be a huge advantage to those that want to engage in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago it was cost prohibitive to create movies that demonstrated scale and grandeur. This was the age of Tinseltown. Scale and grandeur can now be done digitally by a few skilled and passionate artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about if someone created a streaming service online that encouraged small and independent creators to create stories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on a dating site you know that the whole thing is like the Wild West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of unmet needs with people that just want another person to connect with, socially and romantically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly an opportunity in creating a dating app that fixes some of the current issues of the dating market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, nasty messages from strangers. Perhaps enforcing video-only chat instead of messaging will help others to be accountable to being a normal human being instead of a stranger with no accountability, which, I think encourages nasty or lazy messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might be good to have a review system for each profile. Reputable people stand out, disreputable people are buried and eventually banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I can’t help but feel dating apps encourage people to forever stay on these sites. After all, if your business model is based on match making what better than to have people forever stuck in match-making hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a model that moves away from swiping left and right. When you’re bombarded with a thousand profiles everyone starts to look the same after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just some thoughts for someone that might want to pick up an opportunity to make real changes in the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loads of bots on these dating sites. Getting rid of chat messaging and relying only on video messaging will give your dating app a leg up against bots. They have bots that can fake messages, but deep fake AI is not there yet to be able to fake a video call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commenting on a young gal that had her graduation photos taken at the migrant farm her parents worked at.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I appreciate this story, I can’t help but wonder if Jennifer working in the fields led her to a greater human experience and maturity than did the college degree…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few takeaways from this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Danny Trejo is a good man. We can all learn from his character.&lt;br /&gt;
2) James Edward Olmos, albeit a brilliant actor, may have forgotten to know his place. He is an actor, not a gang member. When you can, it’s probably best to stay humble and stay in your lane.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Don’t disrespect the complexity of human culture. For an actor putting on an cholo outfit is a means to an end. For others, it is a way of life.&lt;br /&gt;
4) We should try not to become so lost in our achievements that we forget where we came from and the impact we may have on others. (Possibly 10 people were killed as a result of bad choices in the making of “American Me”)&lt;br /&gt;
5) We should be sensitive to where people come from and acknowledge that experience.&lt;br /&gt;
6) Former convicts are people that have had to deal with an enormous amount of dehumanization at the hands of the prison industrial complex. There is room for change here.&lt;br /&gt;
7) A great way to market your product is to give people free content. I will probably buy this book as a result of reading from this excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final takeaway from this article (and probably most important):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://lnkd.in/d8vWixU&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not lie. You may be tempted to tell an exaggeration in order to demonstrate your product. It will bite you again later. Do not lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always strive for honesty. It’s better to scrap a project or lose customers by telling them the truth. Your customers will respect you more when you are willing to take a loss in the name of honesty. This is how you can become an industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a service or product that you want to share with the world, it is very easy, as the creator, to assume that everyone else knows what problem your product is meant to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t make this assumption – always be willing to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is probably an opportunity for a person that wants to specialize in a mixture of web development, UX, marketing, and knowing what it is like to be illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is not able to read beyond a basic level of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, everyday she manages to make purchases on Amazon, which is an English speaking site. How does she get around the search engine and out of the millions of products find exactly what she needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there is an incredible amount of opportunity in bringing people that are illiterate or somewhat illiterate (usually immigrants or even communities with disabilities like deaf or hard of hearing people) into the tech space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving the underserved can be very rewarding. “Many such cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any person wanting to advocate for change for the poor and meek should spend six months with no income and no cash funds to see what it is like to be an average American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw of those wanting to advocate change for society is that they become disconnected with the people they are advocating change for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company starting a business model based on ISA probably has not worked in religious ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems of working in religious ministries is that you need money and since you do not operate in a traditional sense of profit you must resort to begging for money. This is a problem of cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begging for money dilutes your mission, which probably has a conflict on interest in companies like Pathrise or Lambda School. By begging I mean unrealistic expectations or love bombing potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham, you’re right that Lambda is better than brick and mortar – but Lambda with ISA is not the right model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have students invest with cash. Keep them invested in your program. Free only works for the most virtuous, which is really, nobody in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Income share agreements seem to be generally a bad idea. Your company is starved for cash because you’re investing 6-12 months into a potential client and in order to keep things afloat you need to ask money for investors who are generally, annoying about asking for their return on investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the better approach is to start a company that is cash-flow rich and does not rely on vultur- I mean investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISA is commitment heavy and you’re going to burn a lot of bridges getting your company to be at a respectable place. We live in a low-trust society. ISAs don’t work well in such a society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyundai thinks it’s better to include fictional characters in its advertisement instead of talking about its 100,000 mile powertrain warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much are these ads, Hyundai? $25,000 to display a 30 second ad? People watch this and think about how cute your ad was and then they go buy a Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but feel most people just want plain honesty these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think honesty in our work, with others, and in our own personal lives leads to great things. I’m working on this myself. It is not easy. But a good thing to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies clearly establish a unique service proposition, that is, what separates themselves from their competitors, it would do well to be honest in that USP. (unique service proposition)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed a store in Gatlinburg that had only one sign: “BOOTS: BUY ONE PAIR GET 2 PAIR FREE”. Now these people are being so honest that the drivers-by are coming in to see for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being honest doesn’t mean that you sell yourself short nor does it mean to exaggerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being honest means to live the best life you can live. Today. Now. And again Tomorrow. Always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being honest means to sell the best parts about you, accurately and without shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to monetize learning to play guitar. (Or any other skill, craft, or hobby)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document your work with video efforts. Narrate your learning process from 0 all the way to the 6th month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit the videos with the intention of creating a beginner’s guide to learning guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertise on YouTube or whatever by listing a “before and after” video that adequately demonstrates your improvement from 0-6 months. Title it something like “LEARNING TO PLAY GUITAR – BEFORE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sell the videos for whatever your asking price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the fruit of your labor – maybe you’ll buy a sweet new guitar amp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegedly LinkedIn has had a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see news for this anywhere on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas are usually unhinged thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They come and go. Most of your ideas are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one idea might really just need a solid application based on well…reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t be ashamed of your terrible ideas. Freely share, if you care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is why an “IDEAS” person is generally a useless position to be in. Everyone has ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application is where the money is at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am bothered by the idea that technology has transformed my life into little notification bars, status updates, and friend requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In automating my entire social and work life, my computer and the current state of ideas within the tech industry strip the human element out of more usual “primal” forms of social engagement. (Today, I was at a hardware store and after having had an enjoyable time with a representative, I saw his hand come up to throw the timeless shoulder pat but he seemed to retreat from the thought.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I base these thoughts on the idea that most of the user experience is designed to encourage more response by the means of behavioral conditioning. Check out “The Social Dilemma” (2020) from Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if user experience and the tech world in general strives to providing a more human-affirming experience – whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get to look cool in the masks but they are not fun to breathe in and moisture gets everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commenting on the US Army’s Advertisement to become a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Specialist. (CBRN)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper technology should allow us to make better decisions about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as close to being God-like as we will ever get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that we will need to have people more morally able to make good moral decisions, as we must make the right choice to enable a more righteous future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology can get people killed. While most of us have forgotten about the Y2K event (or non-event, depending on perspectives), it is apparent that technology can get people killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the Pathlans event: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lnkd.in/drwH87i&quot;&gt;https://lnkd.in/drwH87i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must put quality into our work because our work reflects the quality of life in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we will all be our own brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherish each experience and be willing to share your lessons from those experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more stories from people. Regular people. Not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your stories. The world is desperate for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with their myriad of experiences, each priceless and irreplaceable, do not realize the value they have when they share a condensed and focused thought for the sake of helping others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, understand that there is a person out there that is desperately seeking answers and that your clearly focused and well thought out answers can guide them to the end of their current suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken jabs at LinkedIn because I’ve felt that the overall platform encouraged low quality (I feel like the quality of the content is sterile and all the same), but then I was reminded that LinkedIn is an advertising platform first and a professional rolodex second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone else is just along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world power structures reflect actual business structure so that it is clear to everyone who has skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the role of the in-person encounter when the majority of person-to-person encounters happen through the digital space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should stop telling young adults that paying MSRP for university degrees is the right way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know a young person that might be considering college and is considering a non-STEM degree, then perhaps ask them to consider alternatives. You can mostly CLEP out the first two years of college and spend less than $5,000 for the first two years of college. (Each CLEP exam is less than 200 dollars per test and gives you full credit for a college course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the millennial mistake of believing and buying the college lie, there are other obstacles facing millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my strategy for millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change careers that allow you to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abandon the big city living. This is a tough one for me. Big cities usually mean lots of food choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define the definition of small town. This pretty much means not NYC, LA, ATL, HOUSTON, SAN FRAN, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small towns mean less competition. Bigger towns mean lots of competition from already wealthy buyers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save in the small town as you prepare for a downpayment on a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When applying the adage of “good fences make good neighbors” to personal social boundaries, I think this is a really good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this means that there is a certain level of basic fence making that needs to happen even before establishing boundaries with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all boundaries need to be explicitly expressed when first establishing contact with a person. That would be weird and tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of those basic fence structures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) You do not have to continue speaking with anyone. You may stop speaking with anyone immediately. You continue speaking with whomever you please because those people assume a basic level of respect with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) You don’t have to feel sorry for sticking up for yourself. In any situation that involves sticking up for yourself has occurred, it’s already an unfortunate circumstance for anyone. Do not feel sorry for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) You have preferences for everything. You don’t have to have a long-winded reason for why you dislike something or if you do. You are OK with giving straight forward but polite answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) You always reserve the right to say no and you will practice it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy when you are wanting something (like a job) how willing you might be to disrespect your own boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t do that! Good fences make good neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On why you can almost always assume positive intent”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this: if a person must decide between having a negative or positive relationship with someone, that person will choose to have positive relationships with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably almost always 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t want to be in broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can almost always assume positive intent with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But make sure that doesn’t get you taken advantage of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because HR has become an institutionalized process inside of a business. It’s somewhat of a straight forward problem but in reality the application of a solution is difficult, as it would involve rearranging how HR does hiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies want to hire. People want to be hired. But it takes an institutional level of reform to reassess how we hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to find out about someone is to sample their writing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An easy answer for those that have to answer the question “Describe America”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer is Bob Ross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American optimism, respect and appreciation for nature and natural creatures, willingness to accept mistakes and to work with those mistakes to produce something better, and general agreeableness (“let’s you and I make a deal”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Ross is an excellent cultural export to other countries abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I advocate that all naturalization classes for American citizenship start with an episode of Bob Ross, subtitled in the relevant language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a business perspective, it is not a bad thing to be a generalist of information if you can accurately predict trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bad thing, however, if you are a specialist and you’ve lost track of the trends in your industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make sure you stay relevant is to continue being in service to others. Maybe hang out with new people and be a good listener. Buy someone lunch. Donate to a charitable cause (after researching adequately)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of advertising is mumbo jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the A/B split test is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take one advertisement and see how it compares to the results of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test as a rule would reject 99% of advertisements out there because most advertisements have no ability to prove validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why people are handing you samples of beauty supplies at the mall. They give you something free, and they can count the number of people that purchase the product after having taken the sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subscription model is great because you’d really have to commit an egregious violation for people to cancel. People are willing to give the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you think of a business model that relies on a subscription. Could be the next big thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article seems to have lost its self awareness. Normalizing work from home is one of the few high impact solutions towards a more organic, grass-fed and whole-grain world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is written from the perspective of a middle manager)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2021/07/help-your-employees-who-are-anxious-about-returning-to-the-office?utm_content=172097672&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;hss_channel=lcp-972069&quot;&gt;https://hbr.org/2021/07/help-your-employees-who-are-anxious-about-returning-to-the-office?utm_content=172097672&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;hss_channel=lcp-972069&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 32 years to learn this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighten up. Overly serious people are a drag. Dale Carnegie’s first rule to winning friends and influencing people is to smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smile today. Lighten up. Life’s too short not to leave behind meaningful and happy experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighten up and tell a really bad joke and then laugh about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling embarrassed about that one time in your life, go ahead and laugh about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighten up. Smile. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s really important to be sure to grow your personal social networks as you do your professional social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want wake up one day and realize you know very little of your parents, siblings or loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did the right thing by moving to automobile vehicles for the main form of transportation for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horses can be finicky, easily spooked, and downright dangerous to inexperienced riders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of horses were killed in World War I. (Citation needed. Nevermind – just Google’d it) Soft number at around 8 million horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automobiles are faster, can carry dozens, and are generally safer. Also, automobiles don’t require hay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological improvements are for people, the animals, and the natural world around us. Technological advancements can help us to move closer to a world free from suffering. We should design products with that idea in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 4 websites are Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which are essentially advertising platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I enjoy the fruit of the free services of these sites? Sure, yes, I can have my cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why can’t I help but feel I’m just staring at a grocery shelf filled with potato chips?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jekyll/2020/04/04/introduction/"/>
   <updated>2020-04-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jekyll/2020/04/04/introduction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel’s supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll’s loyal butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is the butler for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the static site generator. It’s designed and developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt; to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demo site was last updated August 23, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently two themes built on Poole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hyde.getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyon.getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Lanyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more and contribute on &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-included&quot;&gt;What’s included&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, &lt;a href=&quot;/404.html&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, posts, &lt;a href=&quot;/archive&quot;&gt;archive page&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly design and development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily scalable text and component sizing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; units in the CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll’s built-in support for Rouge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional features are available in individual themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;browser-support&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), Firefox, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Options</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jekyll/2020/04/03/options/"/>
   <updated>2020-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jekyll/2020/04/03/options</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Poole as a baseline theme for Jekyll, there aren’t many options available out of the box. Basic light and dark mode support is included. Colors are also provided for your own customization, while other Poole themes build on this to create more unique looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id=&quot;markdown-toc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dark-mode&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-dark-mode&quot;&gt;Dark mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#creating-themes&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-creating-themes&quot;&gt;Creating themes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#colors&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gray-colors&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-gray-colors&quot;&gt;Gray colors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#google-analytics&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-google-analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dark-mode&quot;&gt;Dark mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark mode is enabled automatically&lt;/strong&gt; via CSS media query—you’ll find the source code for this in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_sass/_variables.scss&lt;/code&gt; stylesheet. If you’re familiar with CSS custom properties, you can also use this method to build your own color schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://markdotto.com/2018/11/05/css-dark-mode/&quot;&gt;Read more about using CSS dark mode&lt;/a&gt; via media queries like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-scss highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Example media query to detect dark mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-themes&quot;&gt;Creating themes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make your own color schemes, modify the CSS variables in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_sass/_variables.scss&lt;/code&gt; stylesheet with a scoped data attribute or class name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, below we’ve created the beginnings of a blue theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-scss highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Example blue theme&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;data-theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;blue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;--body-bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;--body-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, apply the theme by adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data-theme=&quot;blue&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change your site styles by modifying the source code with these CSS custom properties. Poole’s colors come from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yeun.github.io/open-color/&quot;&gt;Open Color project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl class=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #fa5252;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--red)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #fa5252
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #e64980;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--pink)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #e64980
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #be4bdb;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--grape)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #be4bdb
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #7950f2;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--purple)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #7950f2
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #4c6ef5;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--indigo)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #4c6ef5
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #228be6;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--blue)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    #12b886

  &lt;dd&gt;

&lt;dl class=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #f8f9fa;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;

  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #e9ecef;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;

    #adb5bd
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #868e96;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--gray-600)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #868e96
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #495057;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--gray-700)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #495057
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #343a40;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--gray-800)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #343a40
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt style=&quot;background-color: #212529;&quot;&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;var(--gray-900)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    #212529
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specify &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ga_analytics&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; and restart the server to add Google Analytics tracking code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Google Analytics example&lt;/span&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;dis parturient montes&lt;/a&gt;, nascetur ridiculus mus. &lt;em&gt;Aenean eu leo quam.&lt;/em&gt; Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etiam porta &lt;strong&gt;sem malesuada magna&lt;/strong&gt; mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inline-html-elements&quot;&gt;Inline HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To bold text&lt;/strong&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;To highlight&lt;/mark&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mark&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Mark Otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes are supported as part of the Markdown syntax. Here’s one in action. Clicking this number&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-sample_footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn-sample_footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will lead you to a footnote. The syntax looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Clicking this number[^fn-sample_footnote]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each footnote needs the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;^fn-&lt;/code&gt; prefix and a unique ID to be referenced for the footnoted content. The syntax for that list looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;[^fn-sample_footnote]: Handy! Now click the return link to go back.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can place the footnoted content wherever you like. Markdown parsers should properly place it at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inline code is available with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Snippets of multiple lines of code are supported through Rouge. Longer lines will automatically scroll horizontally when needed. You may also use code fencing (triple backticks) for rendering code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;adder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;return a + b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Call the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;adder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &amp;gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also optionally show code snippets with line numbers. Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linenos&lt;/code&gt; to the Rouge tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
29JUL19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capstone Prospectus&lt;br /&gt;
Topic&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking to understand the effects of teaching a curriculum on servant leadership on the self-perceived feelings of empowerment of a learner population within the context of their own organization. Servant leadership is not a new concept. (Gandolfi, Stone, &amp;amp; Frank, 2017) Servant leadership is characterized by leaders that exhibit the following skills: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community. (Gandolfi, Stone, &amp;amp; Frank, 2017) A study by Columbia College indicates that the development of servant leadership skills can result in greater feelings of empowerment and development in the lives of the subordinates of those servant leaders. (Fields, Thompson, &amp;amp; Hawkins, 2015) Those newly developed servant leaders began to understand that significant impact can happen from small actions that would at first glance not appear to be leader-like. (Fields, Thompson, &amp;amp; Hawkins, 2015) &lt;br /&gt;
The implications of servant-leadership are significant because we are currently experiencing a major shakeup in the ethical practices of large organizations, whether it is for profit or not for profit. The moral failings of Madoff, Enron, Tyco, and others are now on public display for all to see. (Gandolfi &amp;amp; Stone, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
A study conducted by Gallup indicated that 70% of the workforce is disengaged. (Morgan &amp;amp; Lynch, 2017) Because of the rise of such a crisis of leadership, a look at why leadership may impact disengagement in organizations, as leadership can have a significant impact on the lives of employees. Another Gallup study shows half of those that leave their jobs do so as a result of their supervisors. (Gandolfi &amp;amp; Stone, 2018) This topic is essential to me because soon, I intend to teach full-time. As a teacher, I am in a position to serve my students as a servant-leader. I am interested in this subject as to how it would potentially impact my current place of employment. The military has a high turnover rate. I am interested in teaching a servant-leadership curriculum and if it can influence levels of feelings of empowerment. This topic is relevant to the field of education because teachers are pedagogues. The teacher has a direct influence on the lives of their students. Servant-leadership can be utilized to increase student motivation and learning ability through the active use of the traits of servant-leadership. Servant-leadership positively correlates with student outcomes. (Noland &amp;amp; Richards, 2015) Since leadership is “the ability to influence a group to achieve a vision or a set of goals,” (Barnabas, Anbarasu, &amp;amp; Paul, 2010) those goals can be directed toward positive outcomes in students.&lt;br /&gt;
Problem Statement&lt;br /&gt;
 The military is experiencing a high turnover rate as well as diminished job satisfaction. Specifically, at my place of work, there is anecdotally a low level of morale. Currently, there are many complaints that service members have on my base. The need for leadership is addressed at times but training specific to what leadership is does not occur, resulting in people feeling unhappy about their current situation. People do not feel empowered to raise genuine issues of concerns and to make a change about their duties. A learning curriculum on servant leadership so that individuals feel empowered to make a change in their work environment and to develop others to do the same is proposed.&lt;br /&gt;
Problem discussion&lt;br /&gt;
The military utilizes a top-down approach to leadership. Servant leadership approaches leadership through a bottom-up approach. (Savel &amp;amp; Munro, 2017) Furthermore, many organizations, including the military, are currently experiencing high employee turnover. The cost of this is high. (Sokoll, 2014) Studies have indicated that supervisors play a significant role in an employee’s retention. (Sokoll, 2014) Additionally, a survey of 7,200 people that have recently quit their jobs found that half of them left because of a bad manager. (Gandolfi &amp;amp; Stone, 2018) Employee values are changing. (Dutta &amp;amp; Khatri, 2017) Servant leadership is researched to determine if turnover and bad management styles can be corrected to increase feelings of empowerment in employees. Because leadership means many things for many different people, often the need for leadership is recognized but not clearly defined. As a result, addressing the issues of organizations in which people leave due to bad managers, or do not express enough loyalty to the organization to stay long enough to offset initial training costs to the organizations, is not addressed as a problem relating to leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
Proposed Solution&lt;br /&gt;
I propose that an interventional learning curriculum implemented into the organization in which I currently work. This learning curriculum focuses on the origins of servant leadership, its fundamental traits, and its potential applications within that organizational structure. I will begin first by portraying the benefits of servant leadership and its statistically significant correlations and associations with increased output, job satisfaction, and employee loyalty. Secondly, an examination of servant leadership’s historical roots. Because servant leadership is potentially an ambiguous concept, the traits of what a servant leader looks like is determined. Finally, applications of servant leadership to organizational management are determined to synthesize theory and practice. Servant leadership is associated with higher work performance. (Ebener &amp;amp; O’Connell, 2010) It is also associated with higher levels of loyalty to supervisors, which in turn reduce turnover rates. (Sokoll, 2014) And because servant leadership seeks to replicate more servant leaders, it is a self-sustaining system. (Ebener &amp;amp; O’Connell, 2010) This servant leadership is associated with job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, job satisfaction, employee commitment, and follower trust. (Kiker, Callahan, &amp;amp; Kiker, 2019) Finally, it is a system that can be taught to both the individual and the organization as a whole. (McMahone, 2012) The study and implementation of servant leadership can yield potentially great benefit from its theories. Each of the points of servant leadership will be divided into an 8-hour curriculum as outlined below.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pre-test is administered to establish base levels of feelings of self-empowerment. This curriculum will be delivered in the unit training room, and the delivery device of the curriculum will be through the use of Microsoft PowerPoint. In between each unit will be a 15-minute break in between. At the end of the curriculum, a posttest will be administered to determine if there are changes in the levels of feelings of empowerment in the target class. Employee empowerment contributes to organizational success. (Greasley et al., 2008) Some studies indicate that empowered employees working in teams are essential to organizational success. (2008) The concept of empowerment defined as being “provided with a greater degree of flexibility and more freedom to make decisions relating to work”. (2008) The “central tenet is that workers respond more creatively when given broad responsibilities, encouraged to contribute, and helped derived satisfaction from their work.” (2008) Continuing, “organizational policies, practices, and structures that grant employees greater latitude to make decisions and exert greater influence regarding their work. This relates to the notion of power sharing between employers and their employees.” (2008) This study seeks to understand a developing relationship between servant leadership and empowerment, and whether empowerment as a dependent variable is affected through the teaching of a conceptual framework of servant leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
Participants&lt;br /&gt;
Twelve volunteers will be chosen to partake in my learning curriculum. They could potentially be from a majority of different regional locations, but will all share in common a military tradition in perspective to leadership and subordinates. They will all have had gone through basic military training and will have gone through petty officer indoctrination school for their leadership and specialized skill training. Less than 10% of my volunteers will have a college degree. Their ages will range from 18-48 and will be both male and female. They will have low motivation to my instruction because of the repetitive nature of other mandated training. Meaning that they will automatically assume that the learning curriculum that I share will also be of the same boring and repetitive nature. They will have had leadership training before, but none of them will have had training on servant leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
Research Questions&lt;br /&gt;
To what extent can my learning curriculum effect levels of self-perceived feelings of empowerment in my learner group?&lt;br /&gt;
Data Collection and Instruments&lt;br /&gt;
A 5-point Likert-Scale is utilized to survey the respondent relating to the 4 points of empowerment: meaningfulness, competence, self-determination, and impact. These four themes will be the core concepts I ask my target learners questions relating to their job and their position within the organization. The questions will relate to job satisfaction (impact), leadership (self-determination), professional development (competence), and purposeful behavior (meaningfulness). The same Likert scale will be administrated before and after the learning curriculum to determine if a change can be measured that is significant, statistically. Because I want to measure the feelings of empowerment, which is first a self-perception, a survey is most appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
           This research method is quantitative. I am attempting to determine a causal relationship between two variables: the dependent variable being the levels of feelings of self-reported empowerment amongst my learner group and the independent variable being the curriculum teaching servant leadership. Through a numerical data analysis to compare between my pretest and posttest results, I can determine a positive or negative relationship through correlation of my two variables, allowing me to see if I can affect feelings of empowerment through a learning curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Data Analysis&lt;br /&gt;
I utilize my Likert scale to determine the difference of the averages of the pre and post test to determine if a change in the self-perception views of empowerment has taken place. The pre-test indicates a base level that I can utilize as my control to compare with the posttest. The posttest should indicate to me any levels of change that I can compare with my control of the pre-test to determine if my curriculum had any impact on the learner group.&lt;br /&gt;
Because my data is quantitative, I can determine a causal relationship through correlation of my two variables: my teaching curriculum and feelings of empowerment. Analysis will be made through the utilization of comparing the mean scores between the pre-test and post-test. The pre-test will establish a base line level of feelings of empowerment and the post-test scores will be averaged to determine if a change in baseline feelings had taken place after the learning curriculum. Both the pre-test and post-test will be averaged by the taking of the total score results of the participants and dividing those tests by the number of learners, in this case, 12.&lt;/p&gt;

Title of Your Research Proposal: Understanding the Effects of Teaching Servant Leadership&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brief Description of Research Proposal (in 150 words or less):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a looking to understand the effects of teaching a curriculum on servant leadership on the self-perceived feelings of empowerment of a learner population within the context of their own organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please provide complete information for each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe the research method(s) and procedure(s) to be utilized in the proposed study. For action research studies, include an overview of the proposed intervention/instruction.&lt;br /&gt;
    Research method will be a quantitative study to determine the relationship between two variables. They are the self-reported feelings of empowerment in relationship to the the learning curriculum teaching servant leadership. The procedure will take place as a curriculum taught over 8 hours to teach an introduction to servant leadership, the benefits of servant leadership, the problems currently facing modern organizations, and taking action to implement servant leadership. Before the curriculum is taught, a pre-test questionnaire will be administered in the form of a 5-point Likert Scale. It will demonstrate the amount of feelings of empowerment my learner group will have before the curriculum. After the curriculum is taught, a secondary post-test questionnaire will be administered. The format will be exactly the same as the pre-test.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe in detail the data collection tool(s) your study will employ (instruments such as tests, surveys, interview or focus group protocols, etc., as well as plans for audio or video recording data).&lt;br /&gt;
    The data collection tool will be my own creation. It will utilize a 15 question 5 point Likert Scale to determine the levels of empowerment a person has currently and after the curriculum. The mean scores will be determined from both the pre-test and post-test scores to determine if after the curriculum a change in the mean scores can be affected through the curriculum teaching servant leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe the research population, including the age, number, and the relationship of any research participants to the researcher (“relationship” includes teacher/student, supervisor/employee, professional colleagues, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
    There will be 12 respondents, ranging from age 18 to 45. They will be fellow coworkers in my work environments. They are all military members.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will your population include any members of vulnerable or protected populations such as (but not limited to) the following: individuals with physical or developmental disabilities, pregnant women, children, prisoners, residents of a facility such as a nursing home or group home, individuals with mental or emotional disabilities, non-English speakers, individuals at or above the age of 65, traumatized individuals, economically disadvantaged individuals, terminally ill individuals, or employees or students of the researcher? If so, explain the justification for including these populations and provide the contextual factors associated with this group of participants. (This refers to studies entirely composed of these individuals.We do not ask researchers to inquire about these categories in selecting participants. If known and part of a larger group, proper safeguards should be in place to ensure vulnerable individuals are not singled out or discriminated against. Please note that when research is conducted in a school setting, children and/or students of the researcher and/or individuals with disabilities are often included and must be discussed here as vulnerable subjects.) No.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your population includes children under the age of 18, identify whether your study poses (i) only minimal risk, (ii) greater than minimal risk but with a benefit to participants, or (iii) greater than minimal risk but with no benefit to participants, and explain your choice. No.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe the steps that will be taken to minimize known risks (physical, emotional, psychological, etc.) to research participants. I will pass consent forms for all respondents as I explain to them the purpose of the research study and to inform them that the information they present in the pre-test and post-test will remain anonymous and that any information will be kept private.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe the steps you will take to ensure anonymity and/or confidentiality of research participants and collected data and how you will deal with personal identifiers. If subjects will not participate in the study in an anonymous and/or confidential manner, discuss why this research design is necessary. The pre-test and post-test will not indicate a name. Any personal identifiers will be kept private, if any, and will require explicit written instruction before any information is released to other stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discuss the procedures you will employ to gain informed consent from each stakeholder in your study, including administrator/supervisor of the organization, parent/guardian (if study includes minors), and participants (informed assent if participants are minors of middle school age or above). Please do not provide the content of the Informed Consent form; rather, describe the procedures you will follow to obtain consent. The procedures will be as follows. Before the research is conducted, a consent form will be passed to all potential respondents. They will be briefed on the purpose of the study and the extent to which any information will be released to others. I will explain to them that the information is conducted through an anonymous survey and that no information will be traceable back to the respondent. Only then will the research study commence once the respondent has consented to the study and briefed on its purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminder: If your research study requires access to members of organizations, agencies, school districts, etc., be sure to obtain the signature of a school or district administrator (for school-based research) or supervisor (for workplace- or organization-based research) on your Informed Consent form before submitting for IRB approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JRT2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
16MAY19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College of&lt;br /&gt;
Western Governors University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product or Program Appropriateness&lt;br /&gt;
The Robinson Curriculum is a homeschooling curriculum designed as an alternative to public schooling. This curriculum focuses on arithmetic, writing, and reading as a core curriculum for the learner. According to the Robinson Curriculum, it stands in contrast to public schooling because of its views of politics, sociology, philosophy, and religion. The view of public schooling, according to the Robinson Curriculum is that the quality of public schooling is very low, producing poorly performing students. Continuing, it holds that public schools are filled with indoctrinated views that prevent students from learning truths related to history and religion. (source)&lt;br /&gt;
This program would be appropriate in my situation because hypothetically I will have children one day and I intend to homeschool my children. There is currently no other formal situation in which I would teach or am a teacher to my organization. Neither am I a teacher in a traditional classroom. This curriculum is also appropriate to my setting because I do not think sociological and political viewpoints should influence the learning of academic truth. Because I want to be able to quantify the results of the type of education in terms of the total cost I am investing in for my children, I do not have them attend a public school because American public schools as a whole perform last in most developed countries when it comes to student performance. Because I do not have the time nor enough resources to allow my children to be experiments for educators that I do not know to have an influence on my children, I choose a curriculum that allows me to view the material as well as being able to put my children through a faster and more challenging pace so that they can become competitive in the now increasingly global job market.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose and Participants&lt;br /&gt;
For the sake of brevity, I will create an assessment of the Robinson Curriculum’s first math unit, which uses the Saxon Math 5/4 curriculum. Specifically, I will assess the first lesson plan of Saxon Math 5/4. I want to test to see if students are able to perform basic recall of mathematical ability upon the end of Saxon Math 5/4’s first lesson. Saxon Math’s philosophy is that it promotes learning through incremental progress and continual review. (source1) That is, topics of learning are discussed and spread out throughout the curriculum and only when the entirely of the topic is explained then does the curriculum move onto the next topic. Secondly, that continual review promotes long term learning of the mathematical concepts through the use of constant review. The person that will be receiving this assessment will be my imaginary child, since the assessment states that I do not have to give the evaluation, only that I create it. My child will be 9, male or female (it does not matter), Asian or mixed. It will be his or her first mathematical curriculum, but he or she will have been learning his or her addition and subtraction tables prior to this. He or she will not be uncomfortable with math, but it will be the first time that he or she will be learning on his or her own.&lt;br /&gt;
Performance Objectives Justification&lt;br /&gt;
My performance objectives are listed below in the three objectives formatted to Mager’s objectives. Early mathematics requires that a student be able to memorize the basic facts of addition and subtraction. Just as a student learns that the nucleus is the brain of a cell, so too much a student learn that two addends give us a sum. Furthermore, a student should be able to know that 7+8=15 without calculation. Finally, the commutative and identity properties of addition will be a concept that is built upon later in the student’s mathematics career. I want to list performance objectives relating to the student’s ability to perform basic mathematical problems and to show understanding of the identity and commutative properties of addition through successful performance of the addition problems.&lt;br /&gt;
My child will be able to identify the addends and sum on the Saxon Math worksheet after reading through and performing the tasks in the Saxon Math 5/4 lesson 1. The ability to identify the addends and sums shall be no less than 95% accuracy. No time limits.&lt;br /&gt;
My child will be able to complete the Saxon Math Lesson 1 worksheet after going through the first Saxon math lesson with no less than 95% accuracy. No time limits.&lt;br /&gt;
My child will be able to look at two randomly thrown dice and create a number sentence from it after going through the first lesson. There will be 20 rolls. This too will be at a 95% accuracy or greater. No time limits.&lt;br /&gt;
Assessment Validity&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for comprehension of the material learned and the ability to perform the tasks that Saxon math calls for. First, my assessment utilizes the Saxon Math worksheet to make my own assessment. The Saxon Math curriculum does not call for the student to make a certain percentage of accuracy before moving on to the next assessment. Second, I am utilizing the same worksheet and asking my child to identify the addends and the sum for each of the problems. Finally, to change things up, I am taking two dice and having my child roll them, write a number sentence from the results, and to give the sum of the two addends of the dice. Validity is the extent to which an assessment measures what it is intending to measure. For example, a geography assessment should include assessment involving geography, not mathematical problems. As you can see, my assessment has a degree of face validity. I am looking to assess mathematical comprehension. My assessment measures the ability to identify addends and sums, to be able to write addition number sentences, and to be able to compute basic addition facts. My assessment is shown in appendix A.&lt;br /&gt;
Assessment Justification&lt;br /&gt;
Basic ability to compute addition facts such as 9+1 does not necessarily indicate cognitive ability. Furthermore, the addition facts that are explained in lesson one is simply memorization. To say that 9+1 requires computation would be a stretch for students beginning the Saxon Math 5/4 curriculum. This is why I am looking for performance objectives. I want to be able to measure my child’s ability to perform math rather than seeking to measure cognitive ability. I do not intend to use a multiple-choice exam to assess this mathematical ability because I am not ready to introduce my child to competitive test taking environments yet. I do not use a project because it would be too time consuming and because Saxon Math utilizes the drilling of math problems, I am limited on the amount of extra-curricular activities that I can utilize for my child, even if it is for a summative evaluation. Formative evaluation is conducted for the facilitating of the learning of the student. I am not conducting a formative evaluation. I am conducting a summative evaluation because I am attempting to judge the merit of the Saxon math curriculum – will I continue to use this curriculum or will I move to a different curriculum? Summative evaluation is conducted for this purpose, among others. But the biggest factor of the summative evaluation process is to know whether or not the curriculum or instruction as a whole benefit the stakeholders enough to justify the cost and process of learning. Finally, I am looking to conduct a performance assessment because Saxon Math provides assessments for me that I can utilize. Because I am pressed for time and typical parents don’t have the ability to both create and conduct assessments, I utilize what I have at my disposal. So, the performance evaluation through the use of Saxon Math assessments are what is most appropriate to me considering time and ability constraints.&lt;br /&gt;
Validity of Assessment&lt;br /&gt;
Validity is a determinant of whether or not an assessment measures what it is intended to measure. Because I am attempting to make a summative evaluation of the course material in that I am deciding whether or not to continue using the Saxon Math 5/4 course as a curriculum for my child, my assessment having validity would be an appropriate means to determine that summative judgement. I want to be sure that I am not wasting my time or my child’s time by giving him or her a curriculum that is not effective to him or her, or that if it is effective, that my assessment was inappropriate in validity and that I take that curriculum away from him or her because I mistakenly assumed that the curriculum was not appropriate. Having a structured assessment like a rubric can help me to stay on track with the intended assessment of the curriculum. I can go beyond face validity by introducing different types of validity such as item validity. Furthermore, I can also determine sampling validity on my own because of the small amount of material being covered in the first lesson. The mathematical problems are addition, and the highest sum of numbers only goes to 18. Because of that, I can create an assessment that accurately samples a variety of different problems that are still relevant to the lesson and has appropriate validity. Furthermore, by ensuring that I stick to addition facts, identification of addends and sums, and the ability to write number sentences from the rolling of two physical dice, I can appropriately assess the learning while maintaining validity. Earlier before my assessment was returned to me, I created a rubric of a collection of data to determine a correlational cause between students that have taken the Robinson curriculum and their SAT scores. Because the task assessment asks me to elaborate on different types of validity, I will continue to use that example. For example, the SAT examination could be said to have sampling validity. That is, it is able to take from a large curriculum normally associated with a high-school education and sample bits and pieces of that curriculum into a test which covers the that entire breadth of knowledge in a relatively short amount of questions for the material covered. Furthermore, the SAT also has content validity because there is a panel of experts determining that the test accurately measures what is being traditionally taught in a high-school education.&lt;br /&gt;
Appendix A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance Objective 1.&lt;br /&gt;
“Correctly Identifies Sums and Addends” Identifies Addends (Total Correct/Total Questions) Identifies Sums (Total Correct/Total Questions) Pass with 95% completion or higher (Yes/No)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JRT2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
11MAY19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College of&lt;br /&gt;
Western Governors University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluation Plan&lt;br /&gt;
The program I will be evaluating will be my own lesson plan assignment in JPT2. The goal of instruction is as follows: “10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.” In this lesson plan I teach military service members the basics of electrical theory and safety. The lesson plan is separated into three different units. Each unit will be taught in the same day with breaks in between. The lesson plan’s depth of ranges from teaching brief subatomic theory of electrons to practical identification of conductors, semi-conductors, and insulators, to the identification of the application of electrical theory and practice in the daily lives of the students.&lt;br /&gt;
This lesson plan is uniquely targeted toward military service members with the understanding that the motivation toward this type of training and instructing being very low. Typical training done in the military is mandatory and can sometimes be very dense in material and covering a wide area of information in a short amount of time. These service members tend to have a negative opinion towards the training and have the association with training and lesson plans with boring and dry information. Therefore, the information in this specific lesson plan is cut into three separate parts to allow for breaks as well as giving people constructivist opportunities to make real life connections to their subjective experiences in the learning process.&lt;br /&gt;
Description of Audience&lt;br /&gt;
The demographics are as follows. 90% of the target population is male. 10% of the population is female. That is, of the 50 service members at the military base, 5 of them are female. All 50 will be in attendance for this lesson plan. All of these service members are military members. They will have had a similar background in their military training in that they all went through military indoctrination training when they first enlisted. Of the 50 service members, 3 are African American, 3 are Asian American, 12 are Hispanic/Latino, and the rest identify as White. Of the 50 service members, six have advanced degrees beyond high-school. The attitude towards this lesson plan is as mentioned above. Cultural characteristics are associated with the military background that these service members share – that is, there is a distinct language, customs and courtesies and behavior that is expected from military members that is foreign to a person that has not been trained in that culture.&lt;br /&gt;
Type and Purpose of Evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
This is a formative evaluation. Evaluation is needed so that curriculum can improve for the needs and instruction of the student, and to inform stakeholders that the curriculum is worth the continued funding or to determine its total effectiveness. Evaluation is a necessary part of the process of curriculum development in many different ways. One way is that rarely does the initial design of the curriculum created target the intended goals. Formative evaluation allows for quality improvement for the student. Sometimes this can be correcting syntax and spelling errors in the lesson, or to create more clearer instruction for the student. This formative evaluation is done because mistakes an unfortunate reality of human effort. Furthermore, the curriculum designer takes the humble approach in assuming that he or she does not know all of the answers and that the process, just like the learning process for the student, is always an ongoing and continuing process of improvement. Summative evaluation takes the quantitative data gleaned from formative evaluation and other data to make final judgement calls about the overall effectiveness of the course. For summative evaluation the question can be asked, “what was the overall impact of the course or curriculum?”. Specifically, in the case of my own lesson plan, formative evaluation is absolutely necessary because this is my first lesson plan. There is most certainly room for error. Furthermore, since this lesson plan still needs to be coordinated with the commanding officer and to be placed in his hands for final approval, formative evaluation will certainly need to occur after the commanding officer places his remarks and modifications on the lesson plan to more suitably fit the overall mission objectives for the base as he sees fit.&lt;br /&gt;
Evaluation Questions&lt;br /&gt;
The focus of my lesson plan is as follows. First, I want to make a lesson plan that ties in subjective experience in the constructivist fashion to learning. Second, I want to utilize behaviorism to teach learners discrimination between types of conductors and insulators, utilizing candy as a motivation to answer correctly as well as make the class exciting. Finally, I want to be sure that learners absorb that electricity though is only visible in an abstract way, makes our lives so much easier and productive. I want learners to have a sense of wonder and awe of how man has harnessed such a powerful and useful force. The questions I wish to ask relating to formative evaluation relating to the levels of interest and curiosity sparked in the learner after the lesson, confidence in being able to explain and understand subatomic theory, and finally, how all of the conceptual abstract models of the subatomic theory translate into useful application in the learner’s own personal world.&lt;br /&gt;
Did the learners find satisfaction in the types of conductors and insulators that they were able to touch and feel to be wide ranging and full of variety? Were the few examples passed around in class enough to provide students a sense of connection between valence electrons and physically visible objects?&lt;br /&gt;
Was the type of candy passed around to those that answered the question motivation enough to solidify the learning between valence electron diagrams and reward? Or should instead of candy a variety of stickers be passed around instead?&lt;br /&gt;
Is the PowerPoint presentation utilized in all of the slides lacking in useful information? Is there any redundant information that could confuse the learner? Are there common spelling and grammatical errors that would cause a distraction to the learning process for the learner?&lt;br /&gt;
Potential Interview&lt;br /&gt;
In this interview I am wanting to ask the learners if they had felt any sense of confidence in their understanding of electricity. My second-fold desire for learners would be that they have a greater appreciation of how a concept or an idea can be made visible in the physical dimension. That is, understanding how valence electrons can be manipulated in order to make electricity flow from one component to energizing another. The interview process would be useful to me because I can ask the interviewees to be able to summarize the lesson plan. In this summary I would look for key phrases or frequency of terms that I would establish as patterns as I finish interviewing all 10 participants. Furthermore, I can ask if there was any sort of fulfilment of learning, a kind of joy that comes with challenging learning material and the feeling of progression. The interview would allow me to ask a question that could lead the interview participant to elaborate on those topics. The interview would be conducted as myself being the interviewer and 10 random selections or volunteers to be held as interviewees.&lt;br /&gt;
Interview Questions&lt;br /&gt;
When designing my lesson plan, I attempted to involve the learners, you, as much as possible in hopes that I would be able to provide a meaningful and perhaps a fun and exciting course on what is typically considered dry material. Did you find that I came close to that original intent?&lt;br /&gt;
If you did not feel I came close to this intent, would you please elaborate on ways that I could have provided for more learner participation and to provide an environment that encouraged a sense of excitement of learning?&lt;br /&gt;
In this lesson plan you were taught basics of valence electrons and how those electrons translate into the ability to conduct or insulate electron flow. You were able to hold in your hands different types of material that were either conductors, semi-conductors, or insulators. Did you feel that holding the material in your hands helped to solidify the connection between valence electron theory and the physical object you held in your hand?&lt;br /&gt;
In the first lesson you were allowed to stand up and move around acting as electron bodies. Did you feel that being able to participate in a physical activity helped to solidify your knowledge of the theory of electrons?&lt;br /&gt;
In the final lesson plan, you were asked to draw an application of electricity. This lesson plan was to encourage a cool down process from an entire day’s worth of learning and to encourage learners to be creative and to “let loose.” Did you feel that drawing the application of electrical theory helped you to think creatively about the usefulness of electricity in your own life?&lt;br /&gt;
If you were the curriculum instructor, what would you have done differently or changed in order to facilitate a smoother and overall more efficient learning process for the learners?&lt;br /&gt;
Electricity is considered by some to be an intimidating concept. Did you feel the lesson plan overall helped you to overcome any sort of intimidation you may have had in understanding electricity? And if you had no prior intimidation towards the subject, did you feel your time was well worth sitting through the entire class?&lt;br /&gt;
What is the biggest takeaway you feel you received from going through this lesson plan?&lt;br /&gt;
Type of Interview&lt;br /&gt;
I am utilizing an open-response in person interview because of the fact that I am looking for motivation and attitude towards the subject of electrical theory. I am looking for changed attitudes toward the subject and often times attitudes are usually conveyed in feelings and abstract concepts. I am looking for a sense of fulfillment from the learners that they are able to grasp a conceptual idea of electrical theory and to feel confident enough to utilize that knowledge into a greater appreciation of electricity. Furthermore, I am colleagues with these learners. I am on a friendly basis with them, so being able to have open-ended interview questions will allow me to convey myself in the same manner that I have known them – that is, on a friendly and casual level. However, the major downside to the interview process is that if I am unfamiliar with interviewing, there will be a learning curve for me to overcome. I choose this over another interview platform such as telephone interviews because I occupy the same building space as the learners that I am targeting and seeking an interview from. Although I have the advantage of not having to build rapport with my target population because I am already known to these people, the lack of observation of body language and eye contact may cause my subjects to feel that quick answer can be given or worse, that a miscommunication can happen between myself and the interviewer because body language and eye contact is not involved. Finally, unlike other questionnaires or surveys, I can probe deeper into the motivations of a person. I am looking for clues as to how a person might become more interested in electrical theory or to find associations that a person finds interest it so that I can tie that association into the study and appreciation of electricity. The interview process over all over processes, allows me to probe deepest into that person’s motivations and interests.&lt;br /&gt;
Potential Questionnaire/Survey&lt;br /&gt;
The evaluations are summarized as follows. I am seeking an understanding in a change of attitude and behavior. I am looking specifically for a greater appreciation towards electrical theory and how it applies to the lives of people. That is, that people can appreciate the modern amenities offered in the application of the power source known as electricity. In this lesson plan, I am looking for people to understand electrical theory in observable behavior through physical activities in a behaviorist perspective. Furthermore, I am looking to make a subjective experience within the learner to make a connection with the lesson plan. I am doing this by allowing learners to draw and to have a hand’s on approach to the lesson. Therefore, the questions will attempt to capture in a quantitative form student’s subjective experiences with the learning material and whether or not the student felt the lesson plan was fulfilling, exciting, and applicable to his or her own life. Finally, I can utilize the questionnaire because I will have 50 learners and due to time constraints, interviewing all 50 will be prohibitive for me. This is the value that I can glean from the survey.&lt;br /&gt;

Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
Student ID: #001160940&lt;br /&gt;
Program Mentor: Ginny Huckaba&lt;br /&gt;
Assessment Code: JQT2&lt;br /&gt;
June 10, 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JQT2 Task Assessment&lt;br /&gt;
Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
I will utilize a formative and summative evaluation in order to determine the effectiveness of my workshop. In my hypothetical workshop, I am teaching on the formative and summative evaluation process and how it relates to overall enhanced learning for the students and the ability to make judgement calls of a curriculum for stakeholders and other invested persons. I want to be able to teach teachers – those involved in the grades K-12 how to better apply formative and summative processes in their own curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Learning Objectives&lt;br /&gt;
Learners will be able to demonstrate the understanding of formative and summative evaluation after the end of the instruction by participating in a group discussion of the summative and formative evaluation process and by participating in a questionnaire measuring attitude before and after the instruction in which a change in attitude concerning the value of formative and summative evaluations is observed.&lt;br /&gt;
Desired Outcomes&lt;br /&gt;
Learners will be able to think critically, abstractly, and with a broad horizonal view of the implications of a curriculum in a young child’s life by utilizing formative and summative evaluation processes by which important decisions can be made to further facilitate a smoother learning experience for a child, or for the stakeholders invested in the curriculum to be able to make the most important judgement call: “Is this curriculum worth the money we are spending on it?”&lt;br /&gt;
Intended Audience&lt;br /&gt;
The intended audience would be between the ages of 21 to 65. The audience would be teachers or those interested in becoming teachers. It is likely that they will be college degree holding individuals. The majority of teachers tend to be female, so I suppose that I could estimate approximately 80% of the learners being female and 20% of the target population being male. Their attitudes toward the subject is likely that they are aware of the formative and summative evaluation process. They may view the subject with monotony. They are probably familiar with the industry terms.&lt;br /&gt;
Relevance of the Topic to the Intended Audience&lt;br /&gt;
Curriculum is a strategic educational plan that must prioritize the learning of one skill over another. Because of time constraints, it is simply not possible to teach everything to everybody or every child. This is why important decisions must be made concerning what is important for a child to learn in order to become a successful in the eyes of the stakeholders involved. Furthermore, because what is considered successful in one’s own perspective varies wildly with another, it becomes evident that the potential for variance in an educational curriculum is great. Because curriculum must adapt to the changing needs of the student or learner as well as maintaining relevancy in an increasingly changing world, the need for formative and summative processes becomes clear. The formative and summative process helps educators to ask the tough questions: “Is this curriculum relevant to our and the stakeholder’s needs?” and, “Is this learning being facilitated as smoothly and as efficiently as possible for the learner?” Teachers have a moral responsibility to deliver the highest quality of information in regards to a curriculum because a learner must invest his or her time into the program. Time is the greatest cost to all people. Valuable time spent on one curriculum means that the same time spent on one curriculum is not being spent on another curriculum, potentially one that is greater or exceedingly greater than the curriculum a student is currently enrolled in. The formative and summative process of evaluation helps us to minimize the amount of time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formative Evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
Evaluating Workshop Materials before the Workshop and during the Field Trial&lt;br /&gt;
I would begin a process of formative evaluation by utilizing the first three phases of formative evaluation. That is, the one-to-one process, the small group process, and the field trial process. The one-to-one process allows me to interview the learners so that I can know the errors in my work. Within this first process, I can use the help of subject matter experts or others that are familiar with the material in order to further seek out potential errors in the information. (Dick, Carey, &amp;amp; Carey, 2009) Secondly, the small group process takes the number of errors and makes corrections and the small group interview allows for me to follow through with my errors in the curriculum, and to gather quantitative and qualitative data. During this second phase targeted populations of learners are utilized for the evaluation of the curriculum. Finally, a field trial is conducted based on the revisions made during the first and second phase of the formative evaluation process. Here finally further revisions are made to the curriculum but specifically, the curriculum is conducted in an environment similar to the actual scenario in which the curriculum is taking place. This final process is where the evaluator makes little to no interactions on the learner. The first two phases involved evaluator involvement for the purposes of data collection. Here the evaluator only makes data collection through the use of the learner or the evaluator.&lt;br /&gt;
I have determined these phases as a result of a creation of a matrix. Within this matrix, I develop questions that are relevant to my form of instruction. These questions can be as follows: “Is the material relevant to the instruction?”, “Are the instructions given to the learners clear?”, and “Is the material relevant to the needs of the learners?”. (2009) These questions guide the framework for my matrix in which I am attempting to answer questions necessary to make the learning process for my learners a clear and relevant experience. This process is known as the instructional strategy. Preceding my three phases of formative evaluation I can also utilize subject matter experts to review my first draft of the design of my curriculum. This can be helpful to my formative evaluation process which helps me to narrow down the scope of my curriculum to what is directly relevant to the learners and stated objectives. Following that, I begin the previously stated three phases of formative evaluation. Within each process, there is a careful set of data collection that I need in order to ensure the curriculum is being instructed as intended. For example, in a one-to-one evaluation, the first phase of my formative evaluation, I may want descriptive data instead of quantitative data because I am looking for information related to the delivery of the instruction. I can ask questions to the subject relating to his or her motivation. Was the instruction boring? Did he or she lose interest before the instruction was finished? Once I interpret the data carefully, I determine useful information from the trials, which would be whether or not the instruction was appropriate. The small-group evaluation builds upon my formative evaluation determined in my one-to-one trials. Here I may wish to determine more quantitative data instead of deterministic data as the group of subjects is larger and that now at this point, I’ve developed necessary modifications from my one-to-one trials. Finally, with the combined data I’ve collected from the first two phases of my formative evaluation I can also build on those phases in my final phase process, which is the field trial. I can utilize the changes I’ve made from the first two phases of my evaluation and administer those changes to the field trials. At this point I must be careful not to determine the effectiveness of my curriculum on the basis on merely the field trial, as an appropriate pre and post test would help me to determine if the subjects had the necessary prerequisite knowledge in order to effectively navigate my curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Justification of Tools before the Workshop&lt;br /&gt;
The first format of data collection that I can use is the structured interview. I want to be sure that I am conducting my interviews in a consistent format to allow myself to stay on track. This form of data is qualitative in nature. That is, my respondents will present information and data to me in the form of a conversation. How can I quantify that? I could utilize frequency observations in my qualitative data by observing the amount of times I notice a certain word or phrase. In this structured interview, I am looking also to develop rapport with my learner. I want to assure the learner that because this is a formative evaluation of the product, any problems that a student may encounter in my curriculum can be the result of my own deficiencies of the curriculum. (Dick, Carey, &amp;amp; Carey, 2009) Depending on that data collection, it could be a narrative format. Secondly, I can utilize a questionnaire based on a Likert scale format. This format is also good for me because it is also a part of my learning objectives. This data is quantitative because I can very easily translate the data into a numerical format and from there to make adjustments in my data to determine mean, median, and mode.&lt;br /&gt;
Justification of Tools during the Field Trial of Workshop&lt;br /&gt;
The field trial portion of my workshop will consist of a Likert scale questionnaire concerning attitude relating to formative and summative evaluations. Since a field trial is intended to be like a dress rehearsal (Dick, Carey, &amp;amp; Carey, 2009) in that the field trial is intended to be most resembling of the actual workshop, I include all of my elements incorporated in my learning objectives. Stated earlier, I mentioned that learners should be able to participate in a group discussion concerning formative and summative evaluations, I can gather naturalistic observations of the participants in my workshop. Because I am gathering naturalistic observations of my learners participating in the group discussions, I am gathering qualitative data. Secondly, I am also gathering two questionnaires, one before the educational workshop and the second one after the end of the workshop and the end of the group discussions. Because I am using a Likert scale format, I can easily compute the data in a quantitative form. I utilize the naturalistic observation of learners because I want to determine if learners can have conversations about evaluations with other learners. Secondly, I am attempting to measure a change in attitude, which a Likert scale can be wholly appropriate for such a measurement.&lt;br /&gt;
Summative Evaluation Process&lt;br /&gt;
The summative evaluation process I intend to use is to first identify the level of congruence between my stated learning objectives and the informational material being transferred to my learners. I need to understand if my material is relevant to my learning objectives. Usually, this process is an attempt to meet the needs of the organization and the material being taught. That is, a company has an issue that needs to be resolved. The congruence phase of the summative process is what an evaluator utilizes in order to make the analyses and data necessary to determine the congruence of the organization’s value and mission statements with the material being taught in response to the previously mentioned issue. For me, because in this hypothetical situation I am the evaluator and I have invented a hypothetical workshop, I can determine whether or not my learning objectives meet my standards by evaluating my material. I want to know if my material transfers information to my learners. I might at this point utilize a content expert or subject matter expert to determine if my workshop meets the standards of learning I am attempting to transfer to my learners. Finally, I use the impact evaluation stage to determine if that information was transferred over to my learners. I can utilize a rating scale to determine this process. The same subject matter expert qualifies my information as being valid, and then the evaluator, in this case, myself as an internal evaluator, utilizes a rating scale to rate or judge my material. This can be listed in a form of subordinate skills or a list of requirements I deem necessary to determine if the material has made an impact upon the learner. From here, I can usually make the judgement in whether or not the workshop was a success for me or not.&lt;br /&gt;
The first step of the summative evaluation process is to determine if the needs of the organization align with the intended outcome of the instructional process. This is called a congruence analysis. (2009) At this point as a designer and evaluator, I want to determine if the needs align with the curriculum by obtain company statements of values and goals as well as the job task description in order to better determine a judgement of whether or not the curriculum is relevant to the organization and job task. It may seem obvious, but the more relevant the curriculum, the more likely learners will be able to utilize those skills and to directly apply them to the job at hand. Usually what follows is another form of congruence analysis of the resources at hand relating to the curriculum. Questions to ask would be whether or not an organization can afford a budget to purchase relevant resources to supplement the curriculum, or whether or not subject matter experts can determine if the resources are relevant and up to date.&lt;br /&gt;
The next step would be to determine a design analysis. Is the material relevant to the instruction? Identifying clearly learner traits and characteristics can help to make those determinations. (2009) This process can be considered also an evaluation of the delivery and overall “strategy” (2009) of the curriculum as opposed to the analysis of the learning materials itself. That is, it may be the delivery method of the curriculum as opposed to the learning materials that deems whether or not a curriculum has the ability to transfer the relevant materials from the instruction to the learners. Along with a pre-test and a post-test, evaluators can determine if the learning has been transferred to the learner. This is called the impact analysis. (2009) From here, an emphasis of evaluation transfers from the learner to the organization. (2009) The easiest way to put this process into simpler terms is this: “Does the curriculum work the way we want?” Below a few instruments of data collection are provided to demonstrate the impact analysis phase of the summative process. This process allows for the computation of the data to make the determination to the evaluator as well as other stakeholders the impact of the curriculum. A final note – it would be beneficial to the evaluator to include respondents for the collection of data, to include not only the learners themselves, the target population, but also managers and supervisors related to the learners. They too can provide input as to the relevancy and appropriateness of the instruction as it pertains to the overall needs of the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
Justification of Tools at the End of the Workshop&lt;br /&gt;
I will first utilize a frequency chart by making observations of my students as they interact in a group discussion of the material after the end of the workshop. As I make observations and annotations of the observations, I will take my qualitative data and determine frequency of key phrases or words that I am looking for to indicate that there was a form of transference of information from my workshop to the learners. This is taking my qualitative data and translating it into quantitative data. Secondly, I will utilize a rating skill chart to determine if my learners are meeting subordinate skills necessary to indicate the transference of information. This occurs during the same time I am making naturalistic observations of my learners in a group discussion. Finally, as mentioned earlier, I will utilize a Likert scale questionnaire to determine an attitude change in the formative and summative evaluation process in my learners. This is also quantifiable data.&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, I want to be sure that the data collection instruments I utilize for my summative evaluation are catered to the needs of the hypothetical organizational purposes as well as actual relevancy to the job task needing adjustment. A practical instrument utilizing data collection can be a rating form for congruence analysis. Here I can utilize subject matter experts as well as supervisors to score on a rating chart the relevance of the curriculum in light of the needs of the organization. Not only can I utilize a rating chart for congruence analysis in the light of the organizational needs, I can also utilize a similar chart to determine relevancy of the content on the basis of my instructional goal. These response questions can help me to determine the overall effectiveness of the curriculum in relation to a summative evaluation. Because I am administering a workshop on the formative and summative processes of evaluation, I want to be sure that my information is relevant to the teachers that are taking my workshop in that they have the ability to take that knowledge and to apply it to their classrooms. Furthermore, being able to utilize a rating chart for relevancy toward the organization can help me to see if the information I am attempting to transfer is relevant to the organization as a whole that a teacher may report to.&lt;br /&gt;
Use of Data&lt;br /&gt;
My formative evaluation data should indicate to me common mistakes made during the process of the creation of a curriculum. That is, spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, unclear directions, or general vagueness in the material itself. Subject matter experts can determine this for me as they review my material to determine if there is any excess or insufficiencies with the material. The summative evaluation data should help me to determine if there was an overall effect of the material upon my learners. That is, did the material transfer the intended information to the learners? Subject matter experts help me to determine if my material was correct or current and the skills rating chart or questionnaires further me to determine the overall effectiveness of the curriculum and most importantly, if the curriculum is worth the cost of continuance as it currently stands.&lt;br /&gt;

Assessment Code: JPT2&lt;br /&gt;
April 27, 2019&lt;br /&gt;
Please see Assessment section of course for complete instructions and rubric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructional Unit Title&lt;br /&gt;
Instructional Problem Summary&lt;br /&gt;
Needs Analysis Findings&lt;br /&gt;
The original instructional goal was stated that learners will pass with at least a 70% or higher on two examinations. One was a qualitative questionnaire and another was a true or false quiz. Originally, the majority of the learner group had scored accumulatively scored higher than 70%. The goal of the instruction is that the leaners will be able to score higher on the secondary examination after the administration of the curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Goal of Instruction&lt;br /&gt;
10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Learner Analysis Findings&lt;br /&gt;
The target population is as follows: all of them have been indoctrinated with basic military training. All of these members find that mandatory training to be boring. Motivation towards the learning material is also very low. The majority of these training events are mandatory and work schedules must be worked around in order to meet these events. All of these learners have English as their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning the Design of the Instructional Unit&lt;br /&gt;
Task Analysis, Performance Objectives, and Learning Theories&lt;br /&gt;
Tasks Performance Objectives Learning Theories&lt;br /&gt;
Outline each concept and/or procedure that the learners need to know to achieve the goal. Each performance objective should include the three parts: condition, behavior, and criterion. Which learning theory(ies) best supports learner mastery of the objective? Include brief justification.&lt;br /&gt;
Understand electricity through the study of atomic theory and the law of electrical charges Condition: Learners will learn what is a proton, neutron, and electron&lt;br /&gt;
Behavior: The group of learners will be individually labeled as either a proton, neutron, or electron.&lt;br /&gt;
Criterion:10 Random volunteers will be asked to be electrically charged or repelled by asking the volunteers to move to the appropriate proton, neutron, or electron. Learners must find the appropriate corresponding or repelling subatomic particle until all 10 volunteers correctly match themselves to another person twice. Reinforcement of behavior can occur through the use of stickers to act as prizes for correct answers, which is the view of behaviorism.&lt;br /&gt;
Random sample of learners are selected and observable behavior is noted in whether or not people acting as atoms can move to other people acting as atoms to discriminate the differences of positive, negative, and neutral charges.&lt;br /&gt;
To identify what is a conductor, semiconductor, insulator Condition: Learners will differentiate between different types of material to discriminate between a conductor, semiconductor, and insulator.&lt;br /&gt;
Behavior: Learners will be selected to hold an object and define if it is an insulator, conductor or semiconductor after viewing a PowerPoint presentation&lt;br /&gt;
Criterion; 10 learners will be able to correctly identify what types of conductor, semiconductor by viewing an atomic structure and picture of an object on 10 PowerPoint slides Behaviorism. Discrimination is needed in order for subjects to differentiate between different types of material. Conceptually material is not difficult to apprehend. Knowledge of material learned can be displayed through observable behavior. Also, it is presumed that the target population has the basic ability to count valence electrons.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, constructivism because objects are handed out and felt and touched as the connection between atomic structure and matter that they can see in person is encouraged through sensate material.&lt;br /&gt;
Learners will be able to explain and understand the useful purposes of electricity and learn a brief overview of electrical safety. Condition: Learners will reflect and understand by explanation the useful purposes of electricity and explain what sort of electrical hazard that could go along with the purpose of electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
Behavior: All learners will pick, choose, and draw on a piece of paper one use of electricity. They will also decide what sort of electrical hazard goes along with that purpose of electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
Criterion: 10 random participants will be selected to display their drawing to the class and to then explain to the class what the drawing is, and what sort of electrical hazard can be associated with the use.&lt;br /&gt;
Constructivism. I will be relating the useful purposes of electricity and safety by connecting the learning material with the subject’s own experience of the subject and from their own personal lives. (i.e. How does electrical safety relate to me?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan #1 Title: “Learning Electrical Charges and about Those Little Atoms”&lt;br /&gt;
Performance Objective: Condition: Learners will learn what is a proton, neutron, and electron&lt;br /&gt;
Behavior: The group of learners will be individually labeled as either a proton, neutron, or electron. Criterion:10 Random volunteers will be asked to be electrically charged or repelled by asking the volunteers to move to the appropriate proton, neutron, or electron. Learners must find the appropriate corresponding or repelling subatomic particle until all 10 volunteers correctly match themselves to another person twice. Criterion is fulfilled when each of the volunteers correctly attach themselves to the appropriate electrically charged proton, neutron, and electron “person” in the room.&lt;br /&gt;
Resources or Materials Needed: A laptop with Microsoft PowerPoint and an internet connection. Instructor will be required to bring enough blank index cards to cover the total amount of volunteer learners, one sharpie, enough tape to tape an index card to each learner’s head, and a collection of small stickers to gift to learners.&lt;br /&gt;
Time: Instruction of the material shall be for 15 minutes and the group activity shall be 15 minutes. Total time will be 30 minutes plus the introductory video relating to Ben Franklin.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Pre-Instructional Activities: A video will be used to gain the audience’s attention. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rPa_Y1stf8&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2: Content Presentation: A PowerPoint presentation will begin with diagrams of atoms. In this portion of instructional material learners will be presented with the information that atoms make up all living and non-living matter. Learners will learn that all of this matter is held together through electrical charges between all of the atomic particles. From here, learners learn that protons have positive charges, neutrons have neutral charges, and electrons have negative charges, and that protons and neutrons make up what is known as the nucleus of the atom. Learners will learn that it is the proton that pushes out energy and that electrons pull in energy, creating what is called an electrostatic field. Finally, learners will learn that protons grouped together will repel each other, electrons grouped together will repel each other, and that protons and electrons grouped together will attract each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3: Learner Participation: Participants will be engaged in a PowerPoint presentation in which electrons have negative charges, protons have positive charges, and neutrons have neutral charges. They will follow along with that PowerPoint presentation until the end of the instruction, in which they will begin an assessment of their knowledge through the selection of 10 random volunteers that will indicate that knowledge has been transferred, as mentioned in the criterion. During the instructional element of the presentation, learners will randomly be selected and asked if a proton, neutron, and electron is either positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral in charge. Each randomly selected learner will be given a small sticker for reinforcement of behavior. For learners that incorrectly answer, write down that person’s name and ask again at another random interval.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4: Assessment: Assessment is indicated in the follow-through activity.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 5: Follow-Through Activities: 10 volunteers will be given a random index card that has either “positive”, “neutral”, and “negative.” They are not to show each other the index card but will be asked to be sure that the index card is taped on their forehead. The instructor will call out, “atoms, show me a neutral charge” and ask the 10 volunteers to assemble an electrostatic field that resembles a neutral charge. Secondly, the “atoms” will be asked to show a repelling of electrostatic force. All of the protons, neutrons, and electrons should be grouped together. Finally, the volunteers will be asked, “atoms, show me an electrostatic field that shows attraction”, and all volunteers should be paired of equally, one proton to a neutron, with electrons choosing to go wherever they please.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson Plan Summary: The lesson should focus on learning electrical theory through the study of the law of electrical charges and atomic theory. Because electrical theory is rather in depth and conceptual, I have chosen to use an introductory video relating to Ben Franklin that displays a broad, historical application of how electrical theory was developed. Behaviorism is used because as students are learning the material, the instructor asks a random student what charge a proton, neutron, or electron is, and giving that participant a sticker when answered correctly. This provides novelty reinforcement of learned behavior and mild entertainment. Secondly, a sample of 10 volunteers is used to indicate to the instructor a base level of assessment of transferred knowledge. The 10 volunteers stand as a sample of the target population. Can the volunteers exhibit observable behavior to demonstrate that like minded atoms repel each other and that unlike atoms attract each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan #2 Title: “Exploring Conductors, Semi-conductors, Insulators, and The Many Types of Electricity”&lt;br /&gt;
Performance Objective: Condition: Learners will differentiate between different types of material to discriminate between a conductor, semiconductor, and insulator. Behavior: Learners will be selected to hold an object and define if it is an insulator, conductor or semiconductor. Learners will watch a PowerPoint presentation. The instructor will have 10 slides that exhibit the different types of electricity. Criterion; 10 learners will correctly identify from each PowerPoint slide what type of electricity the 10 slides convey.&lt;br /&gt;
Resources or Materials Needed: PowerPoint Presentation. Plastic rod, glass jar, rubber hose, tree branch, silicone, glass of water, and copper, laptop.&lt;br /&gt;
Time: 30 minutes total. 15 minutes of instruction, 15 minutes of follow-through activities.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Pre-Instructional Activities: Learners will be returning to their seats after lesson one. The follow-through activity of lesson one will be the pre-instructional activity of lesson two.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2: Content Presentation: Learners will follow through with a PowerPoint presentation that shows an atom with 6-8 valence electrons. (Holt &amp;amp; Mike Holt Enterprises, 2011) Learners will be presented with information that explains that insulators that have 6-8 valence electrons are considered the best insulators. As I begin to show the diagram of the atom that has 6-8 valence electrons, I will pass down to the learners a rubber hose and a tree branch. I will explain that a numerically inconceivable number of atoms with these valence electrons will form different masses, and in this case, these atoms form the rubber hose, plastic and glass rod, and the tree branch. I will continue this activity for semi-conductors and conductors. (Semi-conductors have 4-5 valence electrons; silicone will be passed out. Conductors have 1-3 valence electrons and copper will be passed out.) (Holt &amp;amp; Mike Holt Enterprises, 2011)&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3: Learner Participation: Learner participation will be through the group activity and as I am instructing and explaining what is theoretically very dry material to most people, I will be passing down the materials to the learners to feel and to touch. Finally, once I have passed through my PowerPoint presentation on insulators, conductors, and semi-conductors, I will ask the class. Is water an insulator, semi-conductor, or conductor? I will explain that water is actually atomically an insulator since it has 8 valence electrons but that the minerals and salt actually make it slightly conductive. (Holt &amp;amp; Mike Holt Enterprises, 2011) Finally, as part of the criterion I will be selecting 10 random learners to look at 10 slides each. Each slide will have a picture of a conductor, semi-conductor, and an insulator along with its atomic structure. All of the random learners will be able to count the number of valence electrons and to identify if it is a semi-conductor, conductor, or insulator.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4: Assessment: The assessment was explained in the later half of the learner participation. For clarity, 10 random learners will be selected after all of the PowerPoint presentations have been explained in the number of valence electrons conductors, semi-conductors, and insulators have. Therefore, with a picture of an object and the atomic structure with the valence electrons clearly shown on the slides, learners will be able to count the number of electrons and to identify the object in its conductivity.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 5: Follow-Through Activities: Before I send the learners off for a 15-minute break, I will ask random learners how many valence electrons a semi-conductor has, how many a conductor has, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson Plan Summary: Conductors have 1-3 valence electrons. Semi-conductors have 4-5 valence electrons. Insulators have 6-8 valence electrons. Learners will be able to view an atomic structure and count the number of valence electrons each atom has. As learners are viewing atomic structure and learning about conductors, semi-conductors, and insulators, objects will be passed around the room that will allow learners to feel and to teach the objects that are atomically being counted in terms of the number of valence electrons. This allows learners to connect an abstract concept, something they cannot see, into being able to touch, feel, smell, and to see in a way that encourages learners to make their own subjective connections based on their experiences with interacting with the object and as they count valence electrons. Finally, the assessment is made from a sample of the learners. They will be able to discriminate between semi, conductive, and insulators by counting the number of valence electrons and to identify which is which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan #3 Title: Begin text here.&lt;br /&gt;
Performance Objective: Condition: Learners will reflect and understand by explanation the useful purposes of electricity and learn a brief overview of electrical safety. Behavior: All learners will pick, choose, and draw on a piece of paper one use of electricity. Finally, all learners will watch a YouTube video for electrical safety for non-electrical workers. Criterion: 10 random participants will be selected to display their drawing to the class and to then explain to the class what the drawing is, and what sort of electrical hazard can be associated with the use.&lt;br /&gt;
Resources or Materials Needed: Blank pieces of paper enough for all learners. Pens for all learners. PowerPoint presentation, internet connection with ability to connect to YouTube&lt;br /&gt;
Time: 39.5 minutes total. 15 minutes for PowerPoint presentation. 15 minutes for learners to draw a use of electricity and to explain its safety use. 9 minutes and 20 seconds for a YouTube video.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Pre-Instructional Activities: Learners will be returning from their 15-minute break. When all learners will have been seated, a YouTube video will be presented. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggJo6m8NZtA&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2: Content Presentation: The YouTube video will begin to play to make direct application of electrical theory and how it plays into safety. The PowerPoint presentation will then begin to explain the various types of electricity. That is, electrochemistry, magnetoelectricity, photoelectricity, thermoelectricity, and piezoelectricity. (Holt &amp;amp; Mike Holt Enterprises, 2011) All of these types of electricity will be tied into the various “useful purposes of electricity.” (Holt &amp;amp; Mike Holt Enterprises, 2011) That is, heat, illumination, electromagnetism, and electrochemistry.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3: Learner Participation: Learner participation, assessment, and follow-through activity will be tied together.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4: Assessment: Assessment is made when 10 random learners will be selected. Prior to this and after the YouTube video and PowerPoint presentation is made differentiating the different types of electricity and its useful purposes, learners will be given 15 minutes to draw a concept or object that draws from its useful purpose of electricity or a variation of the different types of electricity. These 10 learners will be required to explain their drawing (in case their drawing is not very good) and to explain what type of electricity it is and or its useful purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
Step 5: Follow-Through Activities: See above.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson Plan Summary: Because the final lesson plan is based on constructivism, the emphasis on presenting the information of the different types of electricity and its useful purposes will be so that learners can make the connection of the various uses electricity has in their own lives and to give them a sense of understanding in being able to identify how that power is transferred into useful work. I hand out blank pieces of paper and pens so that learners are encouraged to think abstractly and to have a little bit of fun in drawing. The assessment is made when 10 random learners are selected to explain their drawing and what the type of electricity it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment and Evaluation Method&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson plan 1: Qualitative. 10 volunteer learners will have a positive, neutral, or electrical charge written on a blank index card and taped to their forehead. They will be asked to make a neutral charge, and a repelling charge by standing next to a person that has the corresponding charge taped to their forehead. Instructor makes his or her own personal assessment to decide whether or not the evaluation matches desired level of transfer of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson plan 2: Learners will be randomly selected to count the valence electrons and object picture on a PowerPoint presentation and to identify if it is a conductor, semi-conductor, or an insulator. Instructor makes necessary adjustments to correct instruction or to guide learner to count valence electrons.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson plan 3: 10 random learners will be selected to explain their drawing and to explain its useful purpose of electricity, or to explain the type of electricity it is. This is a qualitative assessment. Depending on the object drawn, there may be more than one correct answer. Instructor makes adjustments as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructional Unit Revisions&lt;br /&gt;
Colleague was interviewed for the learning unit. Feedback was received in a one on one process. He asked me for clarification on lesson plan number two and what exactly an atomic diagram would look like. He read over the material and I asked him if he approved of the material and if he would make any revisions. He said that he did approve of the material and that he was not sure if revisions would be necessary because command approval was not yet authorized to teach the instructional unit. He mentioned that there would have to be some sort of mutual understanding between myself and the chain of command and whether or not they would approve of it or to make changes as necessary, depending on what the commanding officer decided would be priority in the lesson plan and how it would relate to the mission. I agreed with this as this learning plan was developed independently of my commanding officer. He will have his own opinions on what ought to be focused for training. Until then, I will have to wait before further revisions will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
Student ID: #001160940&lt;br /&gt;
Program Mentor: Ginny Huckaba&lt;br /&gt;
Assessment Code: JOT2 Task 1&lt;br /&gt;
April 22, 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOT2 Task 1&lt;br /&gt;
Instructional Setting and Content Area&lt;br /&gt;
The instructional setting is held in what is called the training room. There are approximately 75 chairs facing a wall with a slide down canvas with which a projector can be utilized to display power point presentations and videos. Facing the audience is one podium upon which a computer can be set to be hooked up to the projector. Behind the presenter stands a large American ensign. This training room accommodates any potential need for the learners to absorb information through the use of the power point presentation. Electrical safety is a universal application – a room with the electronic equipment to present electrical safety and knowledge can be made adaptable to the workplace site.&lt;br /&gt;
The issue occurs in attempting to make the training room a site that translates to all experiences of the service members that work at my base, as some service members at my base work as administration experts dealing with finance and payroll as well as some service members working with logistics and supply. Of the variety of service members, approximately half of the service members are considered engineers and work in environments that are traditionally associated with work environments that involve safety due to the amount of power tools used. In this case a traditional classroom with chairs and power point presentations are unlike the work sites used by the engineers of the base. However, these engineers are used to being in this room for training to further develop their proficiencies, so the environment is not completely foreign to them.&lt;br /&gt;
Instructional Problem&lt;br /&gt;
Enlisted members at my base are unable to articulate basic electrical safety standards. The target group is the number of attached service members at my base. Though not all of the attached service members at my base deal with potential electrical hazards, all members could benefit from a basic understanding of electricity. Such an understanding of electricity should increase the likelihood of compliance of basic electrical safety procedures that can benefit service members in public and personal places that conduct electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
Instructional Goal Statement&lt;br /&gt;
10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Requisite Entry-Level Knowledge and Skills&lt;br /&gt;
The target population ought to be able to read and write on a level sufficient to undertake an assessment examination, previously administered in JNT2. This assessment indicates to me that they have entry-level skills required to read from a Power Point and to be able to take a post-test after the instruction. Furthermore, I assume that I can speak in a language that is biased towards military members, as I will be using military experience and background to make a relationship between the learning and the experience the other service members will have. I can safely assume that the target population has the skills necessary to understand my military language because of the fact that they have all passed the same obstacles that I have in order to be eligible to serve in the military, that being a basic ASVAB entry-level test as well as graduation of boot camp.&lt;br /&gt;
Prior Knowledge and Skills&lt;br /&gt;
There is little to no experience with electrical theory for most service members. The engineers that work at my base have a basic understanding of electricity – and that is only a conceptual idea of electricity. My needs assessment indicates that people might believe that they have an understanding of electricity, they find that they are unable to articulate this question verbally or through writing. There are only 4 members out of the 50-60 members on my base that have a formal training of electrical theory and safety. The rest of the service members are either ignorant to the topic or are mostly self-taught or from hand-me-down experience. There is one military-wide procedure that all service-members know of. It is the tag-out system. This relates to electrical safety because at all times when electrical equipment is to be used the tag-out system is utilized to ensure that all service members are able to identify procedures that are to be turned off and to remain off, or what electrical devices are found to be faulty and identified as such. The concern may be however, that though service members follow procedures for the tag-out system, they may not understand the value and importance of the tag-out system in that it can potentially save lives through preventative safety.&lt;br /&gt;
Learner Group Unique Characteristics&lt;br /&gt;
The learner group unique characteristics are as follows: 95% Western culture, 100% military culture, 12 of the 50-60 service members are female, and all of them are completely used to a monthly training and monthly staff meeting in the training room. The motivations toward taking this instructional course is very low. The majority of meetings and training held by the command and related personnel is viewed by those being instructed as “a waste of time” so the motivation toward my instruction is also very low. Furthermore, the attitude toward the instructional material is also very low. Workplace safety is a topic that is considered to be by most to be very dry material. Furthermore, though all of us use electricity on a very common basis, most people do not have an understanding of the theory behind all of the modern amenities we have now. Understandably, why should they? Most people are very busy with their lives and simply want those same amenities to “just work”.&lt;br /&gt;
Accommodating Unique Characteristics&lt;br /&gt;
I can accommodate for the dryness of the topic by including material that can be exciting for the learners in a way that makes a relationship between the knowledge and their own lives so that the learning experience becomes fulfilling and satisfying. Furthermore, because the majority of training is done in a typical “military” fashion in that material is presented to be dry and without humor and a strong sense of stoic professionalism, I can introduce a casual environment to the training center to promote a relaxed environment. Though likely as with all military procedures there is no volunteerism but only mandatory orders, I can craft the environment to be more casual and relaxed by presenting the information in a relaxed manner.&lt;br /&gt;
Performance Context&lt;br /&gt;
The target population will learn basic electrical theory and safety procedures in the training room where all meetings and training sessions are held. The service members that undergo this training will apply the instructional curriculum towards their own personal lives as well as work lives, where service members may not currently deal with work place safety, but will one day as a result of active duty deployment or underway naval trips. These safety procedures and basic electrical theory will also apply to their own personal lives in that they will have a comprehensive understanding of how electricity works and how it contributes to the many comforts of life, increasing their appreciation of electricity.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion of Instructional Problem&lt;br /&gt;
Enlisted members at my base are unable to articulate basic electrical safety standards. The target group is the number of attached service members at my base. Though not all of the attached service members at my base deal with potential electrical hazards, all members could benefit from a basic understanding of electricity. Such an understanding of electricity should increase the likelihood of compliance of basic electrical safety procedures that can benefit service members in public and personal places that conduct electricity.&lt;br /&gt;
Contributing Factors to the Instructional Problem&lt;br /&gt;
Electricity is a common resource in our society. Until the power goes out, the majority of people that are dependent upon electricity for day to day activities tend to take such power for granted. When asked, most people will be unable to articulate why and how electricity is generated. Furthermore, because most people are not on a basic level of understanding of electricity, they do not know why basic electrical safety procedures should be followed, other than that the lack of following electrical safety can cause injury or death.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Conditions&lt;br /&gt;
There is no indication that service members are either interested or knowledgeable about basic electrical theory and safety. In order to make the comparison, two states of conditions are defined through the use of a qualitative survey and a true or false pretest. These tests will indicate first what the current condition is for the service members on my base, and if the results meet the minimum threshold, the assessment would indicate that an instruction can be a means to meet the desired conditions held by myself, which is that service members are able to articulate a basic level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety.&lt;br /&gt;
Current Conditions. Current condition is that there is no indication to the level of which each service members has of electrical knowledge and safety. Therefore, a test is administered to provide a quantitative and qualitative threshold in order to discover whether or not service members meet the criteria for instruction. This current condition would indicate that service members do not meet the basic threshold of scoring at least a 70% threshold measured from the combined score of the two data collection instruments.&lt;br /&gt;
Desired Condition. The desired condition would be that service members on my base are able retake both the data collection instruments used and there would be an overall improvement in the qualitative survey and the true and false quiz at a minimum passing requirement of 70%.&lt;br /&gt;
Data Collection Process&lt;br /&gt;
Discussion of Data Collection Instruments Used&lt;br /&gt;
Qualitative data was used for the first data collection instrument. Specifically, an individual interview was used so that respondents could reflect and write what they thought they knew about electricity and electricity safety. This interview was guided by a set of 5 standardized questions that were asked to the respondents. Before the interview, respondents are given the option to answer “I do not know” or “I have no interest in the topic” to any of the questions asked. The second instrument is a 10 question “true” or “false” quiz that the same people are asked to answer. This survey allows for a quantitative measurement of knowledge based on a 50/50 chance.&lt;br /&gt;
Discussion of Sources of Data&lt;br /&gt;
There are 52 members assigned to my base. Of the 52 members, 10 members are selected randomly, with at least 2 members from each department of the base. There are three departments on our base. The first is the operational side, which involves logistics and supply. The second is administrative, which involves administrative work as well as pay, and finally engineering, which involves facilities and naval engineers to resolve technical issues.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, a pretest is used to analyze the amount of questions a service member can answer correctly on a standardized test. This will give me a quantitative source of comparison between the percentage answered correctly before the instruction and the percentage answered correctly after the instruction.&lt;br /&gt;
Data Gathered Through Other Sources&lt;br /&gt;
No other source was used.&lt;br /&gt;
Process of Data Analysis&lt;br /&gt;
Data Analysis Techniques Used&lt;br /&gt;
There is no right or right answer for the qualitative survey. But since I want to quantify the data, I measured each “I don’t know” or “I don’t care” response as if it was an incorrect answer. For example, two responses of “I don’t know” or “I don’t care” would be quantified as 3 out of 5 questions “correct”, which would be scored as a 60%.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, the second data collection instrument is a true or false exam. I will keep a record of how many questions were missed, what questions were missed, and what questions were answered with “I don’t know” and “I don’t care”, all of which could indicate that the questions were leading or inappropriately worded. Having a base level of knowledge of which questions were missed the most or answered as incomplete will help me to further refine the questions for the next set of data collection if needed as well as indicating to me a source of instruction that may be needed if the majority of respondents answered the question incorrectly or left the question blank. (The majority being greater than or equal to 50% of respondents answering the question incorrectly or left blank)&lt;br /&gt;
The quantified data is calculated as such: I combined the total number of questions from both the qualitative and quantitative survey for a total of 15 possible questions to be answered. Of the 15, a minimum of 11 questions answered correctly will score a 73%, which mathematically is the lowest possible amount of questions answered correctly to pass the 70% threshold I have established. If the total number of respondents average a percentage score greater than or equal to 70%, my condition is met and instruction is assumed not to be needed.&lt;br /&gt;
Results of Analysis&lt;br /&gt;

Test 9 Percentage Score 100%&lt;br /&gt;
Test 10 Percentage Score 86%&lt;br /&gt;
Total Average Percentage Scored 87.6%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needs Analysis Evaluation and Need for Instruction&lt;br /&gt;
The data from the two data collection surveys indicate that the service members test above the threshold outlined in the instructional goal statement. This could indicate a few things: one, the surveys were inconsistent with the current conditions and may need revision. Secondly, if the instruments used for data collection were indeed accurate to specified requirements, we may have a situation where the instructional goal needs to be rewritten or that service members may already meet the desired level of electrical safety and knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
Instructional Goal Statement&lt;br /&gt;
10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;
I’m conducting a survey to measure the amount of interest a person has in their understanding of electrical knowledge as well as whether or not that person has an understanding of electrical safety to protect themselves and their belongings from danger.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have 10 minutes of your time to answer these quick questions? If so, please continue reading.&lt;br /&gt;
I will ask you 5 questions. Of the five questions, if you feel you have no interest in answering the question at all or if you feel you don’t have enough information to answer in a comfortable manner, you are 100% allowed and encouraged to either say “I don’t know” or “I don’t care to answer”.&lt;br /&gt;
Either will suffice, but all I ask is that you clearly differentiate between not knowing due to a lack of understanding and not caring to answer due to a lack of interest.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are ready to answer, may we begin?&lt;br /&gt;
1) Please explain or elaborate your understanding of how electricity works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What are some basic procedures you have in place to ensure the safety of your electronic equipment, say for example, like your phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Often times in movies when a scene shows a live electrical wire exposed to water, we assume that the scene is indicating danger. Can you explain why there is any danger in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Electricity is all around us. It powers many gadgets and tools we take for granted. Can you think of anything that you could not do without if electricity were not available to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) What are some things you can do to protect yourself from potential electrical hazards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrical Safety and Knowledge Quiz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUE OR FALSE&lt;br /&gt;
1) True / False Only qualified electricians are to perform basic electrical safety procedures.&lt;br /&gt;
2) True / False A circuit breaker provides electrical protection by shutting itself off when the flow of electricity is over a specific amount.&lt;br /&gt;
3) True / False Shock is the only electrical hazard one must be concerned with.&lt;br /&gt;
4) True / False The wire attached to your power tools is the best place for your hands to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;
5) True / False There is no difference between an outside electrical cord and an inside electrical cord.&lt;br /&gt;
6) True / False I should use water to put out a small electrical fire.&lt;br /&gt;
7) True / False An electrical insulator makes it almost impossible for electricity to flow through it.&lt;br /&gt;
8) True / False The first thing you should do when you see an incapacitated person with live electrical wire is to pull him or her to safety.&lt;br /&gt;
9) True / False Water is the only danger I should be concerned with when dealing with potentially dangerous electrical situations&lt;br /&gt;
10) True / False As long as my phone still charges, the nicked and frayed, and exposed wiring on my phone charging cord is completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;BFP2: Task 1&lt;br /&gt;
Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
July 2, 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College&lt;br /&gt;
of Western Governors University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education-Related Research Topic&lt;br /&gt;
I am attempting to collect data on whether or not parental involvement correlates with future success of a young child, indicated by academic success in college. I have interest in this topic because I intend to start my own day care center, and along with myself and my fellow teachers, parents will also be part of the stakeholders involved in the future success of these young children. This collection of data will be hypothetical to me, as I am not currently involved in an educational field nor do I have the participants willing nor able to be able to extract data from.&lt;br /&gt;
Participants&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for parental involvement in the lives of adults that have a college degree. Demographics of my target population will be any race, any age, any sex. To maintain geographic relevancy, I will only be seeking college degree holding adults that have received their degrees in the United States. Furthermore, I am looking for college degrees that are regionally accredited. I will not accept national accreditation as a valid form of accreditation. This is not because I value regional accreditation higher than national accreditation, but because focusing on regional accreditation allows me to narrow the amount of experiences my target population has had so as to reduce the total amount of variables of influence the students may have had.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose of the Data Collection Instrument&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this instrument is to provide quantitative data on the various influences a parent has had on an adult that has graduated college through the use of a questionnaire. I want to utilize a questionnaire because I am looking to determine how much of an impact a parent has had on an adult from the perspective of the respondent, to measure his or her values relating to the impact a parent has had on their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
Type of Data Collected&lt;br /&gt;
I will utilize a questionnaire to determine the correlational relationship between parental influence and future college success. Because the specific type of data I am trying to extract is from adults looking back in their own lives from 10 to 40 years ago, I realize there are limitations to the type of data collection that I have. That is, that memory can be hazy. I will utilize a Likert scale to determine to what degree an adult may have felt parent influences had affected their lives instead of a binary yes or no response, which may skew my results, because of the matter of the amount of influence being a complicated mixture of yes and no. The questionnaire will address various types of influences a parent can exert over their child, like the amount of food insecurity a person may have felt growing up, how much he or she felt their parents were a part of their early school life, and whether or not there the respondent felt a pressure to succeed academically from the parents.&lt;br /&gt;
Ethical Issues and Process to Address&lt;br /&gt;
The first ethical issue that I want to address is the issue of research misconduct, specifically, fabricating my research results to support a theory that I may have, that being that parental influence has some sort of an effect on the ability for a person to graduate college. Fortunately, because I am not actually administering my data collection instrument and am only developing this for my class, I have significantly less bias towards manipulating my results. However, I can be mindful of various factors that can influence a person towards publishing fraudulent results, like the pressure to maintain a grant or continued funding.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, because this data is does gauge personal history of the respondents, it could be considered sensitive information. Because of this, I want to be sure that the information remains confidential and, on a need-to-know basis. I can maintain ethical honesty by informing my respondents the purpose of the questionnaire and how the data will be applied to my research topic. Furthermore, I can inform my respondents the extent to which the data will be shared with other people, and ensuring that the information will only be shared with stakeholders related to my research topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original Data Collection Instrument (Page 1/4)&lt;br /&gt;
A Respondent’s Questionnaire to Determine the Levels of Influence a Parent May Have Had on Their Ability to Succeed in College&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directions: Your response is requested for the following 8 questions. This questionnaire utilizes a Likert scale to determine to what degree you have felt your parents have been involved in your early childhood life to young adulthood to determine whether or not that influence has a correlation with your ability to succeed and graduate college. A Likert Scale simply means that you have a total of 5 potential items to choose from for each question. Circle your answer. See the following example below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A1) Politics are welcome topic in a dinner conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is no right or wrong answer. The purpose of this study is to determine your perspective of how much influence your parents may have had over your academic success and to understand its relationship.  Your response is confidential and will only be shared with the researcher and stakeholders involved in this research project. 
Finally, do not write your name on the questionnaire, as it will be an anonymous questionnaire.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Respondent’s Questionnaire to Determine the Levels of Influence a Parent May Have Had on Their Ability to Succeed in College (Page 2/4)&lt;/p&gt;

Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
06JUL19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College&lt;br /&gt;
of Western Governors University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Purpose and Research Questions&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this research was to understand the relationship between expanded microteaching and the teacher’s teaching anxiety. (Peker, 2009) The research question is as follows: “Does expanded microteaching have an effect in reducing teaching anxiety about mathematics?” (2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Alignment of Research Purpose and Questions&lt;br /&gt;
Peker develops a scale called the MATAS (Mathematics Teaching Anxiety Scale) which determines the total amount of anxiety a respondent can feel. MATAS is based on the Likert scale which respondents can rate from 1-5. Pre and post surveys were included to determine a difference or change in the effect of microteaching. This establishes a relationship of alignment between the level of anxiety a pre-service teacher feels before and after the microteaching experience.&lt;br /&gt;
Literature Review and Sources Support of Research Purpose and Questions&lt;br /&gt;
Peker states that there is a problem relating to teachers and teaching anxiety – specifically for when teaching mathematics. Peker continues to say that these may be a result of past school experiences, perhaps as a student, and the effect that other teachers may have had on the students who are now teachers. (Peker, 2009) Many of these teachers exhibit similar past experiences. Some of them relate to a lack of family support and test anxiety, despite past negative experiences, many of these teachers still want to teach to students. (2009) Peker utilizes a definition of teaching anxiety of Gardner and Leak (1994) that it is “anxiety experienced in relation to teaching activities that involve the preparation and execution of classroom activities.” (2009) In relation to teaching anxiety and mathematics, it is the anxiety that occurs “during teaching mathematical concepts, theories, and formulas or during problem solving” (2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Microteaching is the teaching and evaluation in which “a short, but complete, lesson is conducted”. (2009) In this environment, it is usually a small group of teachers that are acting as students. The trainee teacher teaches for 5-10 minutes and is recorded. After the teacher is recorded and the short lecture has ended, the teachers and the trainee teacher him or herself will also evaluate the video and make constructive criticisms of the overall lecture. (2009) This process is then repeated again to a new group of students, or teachers presenting themselves as students. According to Peker, this process of teaching provides the following benefits: first, teachers get a first hand glance what it is like to teach. Secondly, it allows trainee teachers to become more comfortable in their role as a teacher, thirdly, they are able to learn to plan their lecture and the implementation of the lecture, fourthly, they are able to improve their teaching skills, and finally, they are able to build confidence. (2009) According to Peker, the following are the drawbacks to microteaching: first, it is an artificial environment, second, 5-10 minutes is not typical of how long instruction actually lasts in a classroom, third, the audience is not a group of teachers but rather students that do not yet know the material, fourth, it does not teach classroom management skills, and finally, students ask different questions than a teacher would. (2009) Despite these drawbacks, Peker finds that there is a statistical significance demonstrated in favor of microteaching. (2009) Peker utilizes a data collection instrument of his own creation, the Mathematical Teaching Anxiety Scale, (MATAS) which collects data from respondents in four categories: content knowledge, self-confidence, attitude, and attitude towards mathematics. (2009) This is a Likert scale response questionnaire. That is, the MATAS is a 5 point Likert scale with 23 question items. Reliability estimate was utilized through Cronbach’s Alpha, with a reliability coefficient of .91. (2009) Due to the low sample amount, Peker utilized a Shapiro-Wilks test applied to Peker’s MATAS test. This test is utilized when there is a small sample acknowledged by researchers – this test allows for statistical significance to be applied to a theoretically larger sample. The results were indicated that the distribution was within normal parameter. (2009) ANCOVA results indicated a statistical significance in favor of microteaching. (2009) Peker explains limitations within his research. One was that the sample was not a random sample from his target population. (2009) Peker describes his research as quasi-experimental. Secondly, he explains that his target population is too small to make large inferences to a greater population. (2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Research Method&lt;br /&gt;
Although Peker describes his research method as quasi-experimental, his research is indicated through his own comments, that he sought a quantitative method in analyzing the data. He admits that he had not utilized a random sampling but instead that the teachers utilized for the research were volunteers. (2009) In regards to the MATAS, Peker had his sample take a pre-test and then a post test, the post-test happening after the experimental group had taken the microteaching experience. His sample was separated into two groups, 21 (12 females and 9 males) were the experimental group, and 22 (10 females and 12 males) were the control group. His control group utilized the traditional method of teaching, which was to simply conduct a lecture to 9th graders without microteaching nor other verbal or written instruction. The experimental group utilized the microteaching method described in the above literature review. After both the experimental and control group finished their lectures, they were directed to the post-test MATAS.&lt;br /&gt;
Appropriateness of Research Method&lt;br /&gt;
Because Peker utilized his own data collection instrument, the MATAS, which is a Likert scale-based questionnaire, it is easy to see why he utilized the quantitative data approach. It is easier to determine causal factors through the use of quantitative data. Furthermore, he utilized a reliability test determined through Cronbach’s Alpha, since the MATAS was a test Peker created on his own. Furthermore, to offset Peker’s small research sample, he utilized a Shapiro-Wilk test to test for normality. (2009) Because he is attempting to determine a casual relationship of the independent variable, microteaching, he utilizes a quantitative approach to determine the total number or mean difference between how the sample felt before microteaching, and after. Since Peker does admit that the research method was quasi-experimental due to the lack of random sampling, he does utilize the Shapiro-Wilk to account for his other shortcoming, which is the lack of a large sample size. His shortcomings to a random sample size may have been a result of a lack of resources or time.&lt;br /&gt;
Methods of Data Collection&lt;br /&gt;
The actual data utilized to determine causal relationship between microteaching and perceived difference in anxiety was extracted through Peker’s own MATAS survey. This utilizes a 5-point Likert scale self-report in which respondents answered 23 items divided into four categories: content knowledge, self-confidence, attitude towards mathematics teaching, and teaching knowledge. This method was then tested for reliability utilizing Cronbach’s Alpha, with a resulting reliability coefficient rating of 0.91. Finally, Peker utilizes the Shapiro-Wilks to test for normality due to the small sample size. (2009) The maximum score on Peker’s MATAS is 115, and the lowest is 23. (2009) Total points were used to determine anxiety levels, so lower is low anxiety. The mean was determined from the total of both the groups, control and experimental, and they were used to compare with the post-test results to indicate whether or not the mean score had fallen after the use of microteaching, which means there is a lower self-perception of anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;
Alignment of Data Collection Methods and Research Purpose and Questions&lt;br /&gt;
Because the research questions are attempting to investigate the relationship between microteaching and anxiety levels, the quantitative data approach was appropriate for determining the research question. The MATAS specifically asks questions relating to teaching, anxiety, and mathematics knowledge, which the research question seeks to determine the relationships of. The MATAS then allows for Peker to have data of the mean responses of the sample. With the mean average of pre-test and post-test for both the experimental and control group, Peker can then compare the scores to determine if the microteaching had an effect in lowering the overall mean score of the experimental group. While reliability was tested with Cronbach’s Alpha and normality was tested with Shapiro-Wilks, there did not appear to be an indicator if the researcher tested for validity.&lt;br /&gt;
Data Analysis Techniques&lt;br /&gt;
Peker takes the mean data from the sum of the total possible score of each respondent and compares the pre-test and post-test scores to determine if there was a change in perceived anxiety. This score was also tested for normality utilizing the Shapiro-Wilks test, which states that if p &amp;gt; 0.05, then the results are normally skewed. Peker utilizes this approach because he admits that his sample size is small, and later discusses in his research paper that the small sample size was one limitation resulting from his research. In this case, Peker’s mean score resulted in a .363 &amp;gt; .05, which indicates that indeed, the results are normally skewed. Secondly, Peker analyzed the data using ANCOVA, or a one-way analysis of the covariance. (2009) This is utilized to minimize the effect of variances between the dependent variable and other potential factors that may skew the tests. ANCOVA helps to “adjust the post-test scores statistically to compensate for the [3-point] difference between the two groups.” (2009) ANCOVA helps to determine and adjust for more accurate results. (2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Results of the Study in Relation to Research Questions&lt;br /&gt;
The mean score of the experimental group was M=41.667 and M=42.636 was for the control group. These were pre-test readings. The post-test readings are as follows: The experimental group was M=36.523 and the control group was M=40.274. The ANCOVA adjusted for the differences and found that the results were statistically significant in favor of microteaching. (2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Research Findings Evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
Though no specific methods were mentioned to indicate validity of Peker’s MATAS, Peker does mention the subcategories of the test to indicate what exactly the MATAS measured, but we do not have an overall list of the test items. He admits that because his sample was not random but rather were a group of teacher volunteers. He also indicates that this is not entirely uncommon for the teaching field due to practical reasons. Reliability was effectively tested for and he also accounts for his small sample size by utilizing Shapiro-Wilks test. Finally, he utilizes the ANCOVA analysis to minimize the overall number of other factors that may have caused the difference in the spread of the pre-test and post-test. Overall the findings indicate that the mean score of the MATAS was lower after the intervention of microteaching, compared to the control group in which teachers essentially began teaching right away to a group of 9th graders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education-Related Research Topic&lt;br /&gt;
I am researching the effects of phonological awareness in deaf and hard of hearing children. (DHH) There is very little empirical research covered relating to DHH children and proven reading curriculums that help DHH children to overcome their disability to becoming a competent reader. I am interested in the process children involve themselves in that causes them to become a competent reader or a marginal reader, and whether or not specifically, DHH children learn through the same process of reading, regardless of hearing disability.&lt;br /&gt;
Research Problem Statement&lt;br /&gt;
There is a problem of DHH children and their ability to read on a level similar to their hearing peers. Despite typical intervention processes to assist DHH children with reading ability, deaf children still continue on to plateau at approximately a fourth-grade level of reading. The research seeks to determine whether or not intervention through phonological awareness results in increased reading comprehension in DHH children. In this research, it was determined that phonological awareness does indeed play a major role in the future success of a child’s reading ability, and that interventions relating to phonological awareness can directly contribute to a DHH child’s ability to read at a competitive rate.&lt;br /&gt;
Literature Review&lt;br /&gt;
The ability to read significantly impacts adulthood. As you and I read through research papers, signs, newspapers, and books, we take for granted that the reading comprehension ability was learned through hard work. It is not easy for most children to learn the skill of reading comprehension. (John L. Luckner &amp;amp; C. Michele Handley, 2008) But once the skill has been learned, there are countless benefits resulting from the ability to read with ease and critical thinking ability. For example, those that read more are more likely to be smarter than their peers. (John L. Luckner &amp;amp; C. Michele Handley, 2008) Not only does reading make you smarter, but it also gives you the potential pathway to personal fulfillment. Reading, like mathematics, is all around us and are the skills that we utilize to navigate through our world. Much of those skills are learned and then processed in an unconscious manner – that is, skilled readers do not become fatigued as easily when reading material as would a person that struggles with reading comprehension. Reading is important. And it is becoming increasingly more important in a world that is becoming increasingly more technologically complex. (John L. Luckner &amp;amp; C. Michele Handley, 2008) Manuals will need to be read. Emails will need to be read. It is a tremendous tragedy that people will be left behind with reading comprehension in a world that increasingly demands more material to be read and comprehended. Many deaf children grow up to become what is known as a low-function deaf person. (LFD) Because of their low reading comprehension, they are unable to maintain jobs – typically, even low-skill, low-wage jobs require that material be read for the sake of training purposes. For an LFD person, he or she may be at a fourth-grade level of reading when typically, most jobs require much higher levels of reading. (Bowe, 2002) For example, trade school or vocational schools require at least a sixth-grade level of reading ability. (Bowe, 2002) As of 2002, approximately 54,000 LFD persons had their income supplemented by the Supplemental Social Security Income. (Bowe, 2002) That is, 54,000 LFD persons missed their chance to read at a comfortable and pleasurable level. Even more so, they are unable to hold jobs that can give them further opportunities to follow their own pursuit of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;
DHH children have historically underperformed when compared to their hearing counterparts, specifically, a great majority of DHH children graduate school with only achieving fourth grade levels of reading and reading comprehension. (Wang, Spychala, Harris, &amp;amp; Oetting, 2013) Furthermore, DHH children are 18x more likely to express reading comprehension deficits than their counterparts. (Camarata, Werfel, Davis, Hornsby, &amp;amp; Bess, 2018) Children with even mild levels of hearing loss are also at a significant disadvantage compared to their counterparts. (Camarata, Werfel, Davis, Hornsby, &amp;amp; Bess, 2018) The average DHH adult 18 to 19 years old reads at an 8 or 9-year-old level. (Trezek, 2005) Furthermore, DHH children do not learn at the same rate – hearing children gain about one year’s worth of reading level each year whereas DHH children are gaining at approximately 2-3 months reading level, and rather inconsistently. (Trezek, 2005) The research indicates that there is a gap of performance between DHH and hearing children. DHH children grow up to become low functioning adults. (LFD) These adults simply do not meet the requirements to hold even a low-skill job as they cannot read at a level high enough required to partake in the training of a new employee. This is a great cost to DHH children that will one day become adults – they are chained to a lifetime of illiteracy, academic frustration, and diminished economic potential – common blessings we take for granted every day.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2003, the Department of Education summarized the emphasis of the No Child Left Behind’s principles by stating, “for too many years, too many schools have experimented with lessons and materials that have proven to be ineffective – at the expense of their students.” (John L. Luckner &amp;amp; C. Michele Handley, 2008) For the myriad of research relating to effective reading practices for hearing children, there exists very little evidence-based research on DHH children and their diminished ability to read, and what intervention can be included to overcome the hearing disability in regards to reading. (John L. Luckner &amp;amp; Christine Cooke, 2010) There is proof for hearing children that early intervention results in improvement of early skills necessary to becoming a competent reader. There exists very little evidence or research for DHH children. (Scott, Goldberg, Connor, &amp;amp; Lederberg) Early intervention also suggests success for DHH children. If linguistic experiences have not become solidified by the age of 11 or 12, the brain appears to turn off those abilities, perhaps through a pruning process. (Bowe, 2002) Furthermore, interviews with DHH young adults in the college environment found that “early parental instruction, a rich linguistic environment at home, early and sustained instruction in strategies to attack written texts, and an enjoyment of reading were the common characteristics.” (Bowe, 2002) For hearing children, researchers know about reading and the ability to decode the language in that oral language and reading are intertwined. (Camarata, Werfel, Davis, Hornsby, &amp;amp; Bess, 2018) A major factor in reading comprehension is the ability to decode the text through the use of phonological awareness. (Camarata, Werfel, Davis, Hornsby, &amp;amp; Bess, 2018) This concept of phonological awareness depends on auditory input early in the child’s life. (Park, Lombardino, &amp;amp; Ritter, 2013) To clarify, phonological awareness is “the ability to analyze and manipulate the sounds of spoken words. (Camarata, Werfel, Davis, Hornsby, &amp;amp; Bess, 2018) As you can see, a DHH child does not make use of the auditory input of sounds and symbols together because of his or her disability relating to sound. Because of this obvious fact, it would appear to be that phonological awareness was not taught to DHH children because of the fact that they are unable to make the auditory connection between symbol and sound. According to researchers, phonological awareness is critical to the academic success in a child. The National Reading Panel in 2000 noted that “phonemic awareness and letter knowledge [are] the two best school entry predictors of how well children will learn to read during the first 2 years of instruction.” (Wang, Spychala, Harris, &amp;amp; Oetting, 2013) The question remains whether DHH children underperform compared to their peers as a result of the lack of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness and its role in reading comprehension must be further examined, as historically phonological awareness as instruction for DHH children has not been considered. (Wang, Spychala, Harris, &amp;amp; Oetting, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
This study focuses on phonological awareness and its impact on reading. There is a large body of work that indicates that a child with a reading disability also experiences difficulty with phonological awareness. (Park, Lombardino, &amp;amp; Ritter, 2013) This vital connection between auditory signals and characters helps a child to quickly measure “perceptual weighting strategies” (Park, Lombardino, &amp;amp; Ritter, 2013), critical to the comprehension of a sentence. Because of the strong relationship between phonological awareness and its impact on the ability to fluently navigate a sentence and to glean from it reading comprehension, it could be explained that DHH children lack reading ability due to the result of a lack of phonological awareness – a missed opportunity to associate auditory signal and symbols together at the necessary critical ages in which a hearing child would usually begin to learn to read. Children with even mild to moderate hearing loss show phonetic errors as well as phonological impairment alike to hearing children with the same phonological impairment. (Park, Lombardino, &amp;amp; Ritter, 2013) This implies some sort of universality with the development of reading in children. In fact, a study by Yi-Hui Chen indicates that phonological awareness instruction can be applied to the Cantonese language (Chen, 2014), a language that has three separate use of tones for the purposes of carrying a message. Again, even for a language as complex as the Chinese language, specifically Cantonese, phonological awareness indicated the ability to predict effective Chinese reading. (Chen, 2014) Chen’s study found that indeed phonological awareness, along with learning that is relational, that is, relevant to the child’s experience, produced statistically significant levels of increase reading ability. (Chen, 2014) Perhaps the best example of phonics and phonological awareness can be summed up through the works of Dr. Seuss. The Cat in the Hat makes a very good example of phonemic awareness because of its use of rhyme and alliteration. This type of reading encourages a child to read aloud in order to make sense of the words and its relation to patterns and predictability. (Bowe, 2002) The genius of Dr. Seuss and his ability to teach phonological awareness in a way that is relevant and meaningful as an experience to children enables children to begin to internalize the unwritten rules of reading as well as establishing a concept that readers with reading impairment struggle to understand – that reading can be predictable and that patterns of letters and words can be established. (Narr, 2006)&lt;br /&gt;
Now that the importance of phonological awareness has been established, how then can educators teach the manipulation of letters and sounds to children with hearing disabilities? Studies indicate that the phonological impairment of hearing and DHH children are similar if not the same. (Webb &amp;amp; Lederberg, 2012) Not only are the impairments similar to that of hearing children, it would appear to be that the developmental sequence of DHH children and hearing children in relation to phonological awareness is also similar. (Webb &amp;amp; Lederberg, 2012) This establishes a basis of a potential hypothesis, that if impairment for phonological awareness for both hearing and DHH children are similar, can similar methods emphasizing phonological intervention be adapted to DHH children in order to level the playing field for DHH children, despite hearing disability?&lt;br /&gt;
Research indicates that actually, DHH children do not need to utilize spoken language ability in order to understand and make use of phonological awareness. (Narr, 2006) The research indicates that internal representations are adequate for DHH children to make use of phonological awareness. (Narr, 2006) This internalization of the lexicon of words and sounds can be utilized through manual or visual coding. (Narr, 2006) There are in fact multiple ways a DHH child can access phonological thinking, either through residual auditory methods or through kinesthetic and tactile methods. (Narr, 2006) For teachers, this broad and atypical approach to teaching phonological awareness to DHH children indicates a need for educational troubleshooting. Visual Phonics and Cued Speech are potential solutions for DHH children that emphasize phonological skills specifically targeted to DHH children. (Trezek, 2005) (Trezek, Wang, Woods, Gampp, &amp;amp; Paul, 2007) The studies for Visual Phonics and Cued Speech so far have conveyed statistically significant results in its effectiveness; specifically, with Visual Phonics the results appeared consistently throughout all variations of hearing loss. (Trezek, 2005) That is to say, that phonological awareness, the ability to manipulate sounds in its relationship to words, can be taught to children with various levels of hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, phonological awareness in itself is not enough to improve a child’s reading capability, though the studies have indicated phonological awareness is a strong predictor in future academic success. On one hand, intervention attacking phonological awareness indicates that there is statistical significance of its effect on DHH children. (Trezek, 2005) Despite its statistical significance, there is still very little research in comparison to the effect it has on hearing children. (Park, Lombardino, &amp;amp; Ritter, 2013) In fact, there exists a growing dichotomy of thought that insists that phonological awareness is not significantly correlated. (Chen, 2014) This is why it is important to focus on all aspects of the reading process as outlined in the National Reading Panel – that is, “phonemic awareness, phonic analysis, fluency, vocabulary, and text comprehension.” (Schirmer, Therrien, Schaffer, &amp;amp; Schirmer, 2009) Sometimes, studies are only focused on vocabulary and text comprehension. This is why it may be necessary to approach the whole concept of reading in a holistic manner. For example, alphabetic knowledge, which is defined as the knowledge that “written graphemes correspond to the phonemes of spoken words”, (Bergeron, Lederberg, Easterbrooks, Miller, &amp;amp; Connor) also is associated by correlation to phonological awareness and reading ability. (Bergeron, Lederberg, Easterbrooks, Miller, &amp;amp; Connor) In my research to discover how children learn to read, I discovered that phonological awareness was a key indicator to reading success in hearing children. Upon this research I also discovered that a lack of research was completed for phonological awareness in DHH children – rightly so, as educators could just as easily have assumed that building phonological awareness in deaf children was a lost cause since they cannot hear or have impaired hearing in the first place. Thankfully, some researchers chose to study the intervention process of phonological awareness in DHH children despite what might seem to be an obvious fact. The studies indicate that intervention can be successful. But to be clear, phonological awareness is simply not enough to indicate a child’s total ability to read. (Chen, 2014) But coupled with a holistic approach, that is, attacking all five of the processes of reading outlined in the National Reading Panel, educators can utilize principles such as making sure content is easily accessible, as well as ensuring the thinking process and content are visible for DHH children (Dostal, Gabriel, &amp;amp; Weir, 2017) with an emphasis on statistically significant data that indicates that phonological awareness does indeed, point to reading success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose Statement of the Research Study&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact phonological awareness, a skill usually correlated with reading success in hearing children, in DHH children and whether or not a lack of ability to hear or a diminished ability to hear prevents DHH children from building phonological awareness.&lt;br /&gt;
Open-Ended Research Questions&lt;br /&gt;
What is the impact and statistical significance of Visual Phonics and Cued Speech on a classroom with only DHH children?&lt;br /&gt;
What type of lifestyle do the parents of academically successful DHH live?&lt;br /&gt;
Justification of Research Approach for Each Research Question&lt;br /&gt;
For my first question, I am looking to develop the relationship of Visual Phonics and Cued Speech and increased reading ability. Typically, DHH children do not attend a classroom that is exclusive to DHH children. They are usually in a classroom with hearing children. I would like to know if the classroom environment that is exclusively catered to DHH children would bring a greater statistical impact to increased reading ability through the use of Visual Phonics or Cued Speech. I have my own thoughts about whether or not curriculum is compromised when a teacher has to focus on both teaching and also catering to the one or two DHH children in a classroom full of hearing children. Quantitative data would help me to develop a pre-intervention and post-intervention data that would allow me to compare with data from intervention with a mixed classroom environment. Because there is still a dichotomous opinion on whether phonological awareness is the major predictor for reading success, I want to narrow down my data further. Is there any quantitative difference in increased reading ability in a classroom exclusively for DHH children?&lt;br /&gt;
For my second question, I want to develop a qualitative approach to my research question. I want to interview the parents of DHH children and determine if there is any sort of relationship that exists between academically successful DHH children and the lives of their parents. For all children, parents play a large role in the shaping of those children. I want to know what sort of habits the parents of DHH children instilled into their children in order to enable their children to read at a competitive rate, despite the various obstacles DHH children must overcome. This interview process allows me to develop rapport with the parents and children as well as looking deeper into their beliefs, attitudes, and perhaps personally identified traits that helped their children to overcome disabilities. Because phonological ability and its correlation with reading ability is still being explored, a qualitative approach by interviewing my subjects can help me to discover in an exploratory way perhaps another trait beyond phonological awareness that predicts future reading success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education Related Research Topic&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking to explore the impact phonological or phonics-based reading has on children that are hard of hearing and or deaf. I want to know if the phonics-based curriculum can have a positive and long last impact on children with the above-mentioned learning disabilities. Traditionally a phonics-based program can be effective for teaching young children to read because children are able to pronounce words as they hear the phonetic differences in each word. Deaf and/or hard of hearing children are presented with the challenge of being unable to hear clearly a phonetic structure of a word.&lt;br /&gt;

Explanation of Usefulness&lt;br /&gt;
I included hard of hearing for the majority of my search terms because I am looking for results relating to deaf and hard of hearing children. The best results for me were search terms that included hard of hearing, deaf, impact, reading comprehension, phonics, and children. I believe that reading comprehension and deaf children probably are the core words that brought me the most amount of search results. Using this search, I was able to discover that there was a great deal of interest in phonics and reading ability for young children with hearing disabilities. I think that further including search terms hard of hearing are likely superfluous because of the proper terminology of deaf children would also be to include deaf and/or hard of hearing, since there exists a spectrum of the total amount of hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

Action research. The purpose was to determine the overall effectiveness of adopting a process of association of words to images to help DHH or deaf and hard of hearing children to make the necessary connections to develop the phenome and grapheme skills necessary to read. Traditionally, children are utilizing sounds and letters or symbols to make connections in the language acquisition process. Here in this study, Bergeron et al. publish a study to determine the overall effectiveness of an attempt to teach children the phenome and grapheme connections through the use of semantic association. That is, the letter m can be understood with a picture of a child with ice cream and the instructor saying “mmmm, that’s good.” (Bergeron, Easterbrooks, &amp;amp; Connor, 2009) The results of the study show that semantic association to teach DHH children the phenome-grapheme correspondence works, (2009) especially in the case of individual children. The multisensory approach as well as an association that narrows the amount of “normal” language capability to transfer the knowledge of phenome-grapheme correspondence to an approach that suits DHH children can help DHH children to overcome significant obstacles relating to their learning disabilities. A strength of this study is that individual children can have instruction tailored to their own needs according to the level of hearing disability, according to the semantic association approach. A weakness of this study is that only a semantic association approach was utilized – there are many other curriculums available to DHH children. There is nothing in this study that allows for a strong comparison between semantic association and other learning platforms.&lt;br /&gt;

Action research. Chen explores the relationship of phonological awareness and reading ability in children that are DHH – with the notable difference being that Chen studies the impact phonological awareness has in DHH children with it pertains to the Chinese language. Chen admits that there is dichotomy between two schools of thought – that there is either no impact phonological awareness has on readers, and that the impact is great. The results of Chen’s study indicate that there is a significant impact phonological awareness has on children that have DHH – even with variables accounted for such as different hearing aids. This study indicates that the phonological instruction can be developed to aid in the learning of languages with such difficulties as Chinese, where intonation is split into three tones – one same word on paper said in a different tone can have three different meanings. The findings indicate a strength of the study; the ability to transfer phonological knowledge implies increased universality for children with DHH and even with children without DHH disabilities. A weakness of the study would be that the study was conducted with only a small portion of students, meaning that there was a relatively small sample of learners for this particular study.&lt;br /&gt;

Action research, quantitative. Goldberg and Lederberg seek to further study the effects of phonological awareness on children’s abilities to read. Like Chen, Goldberg and Lederberg also note the widening dichotomy of the types of thought relating to the efficacy of phonological awareness and its impact on reading. This study instead looks to the impact various components of phonological awareness has on learners as well as studying the patterns of learning of DHH children to identify name-cued letter sound learning. Findings include that letter names are twice as likely to be identified as letter sounds for DHH children, which indicate a pattern of underperformance for DHH children. Another finding indicates that as a result of a lack of phonological ability, DHH children are much more likely to utilize kinesthetic and visual cues to supplement phonological awareness. (Goldberg &amp;amp; Lederberg, 2014) A strength to this study is that patterns of phonological development in DHH is thoroughly established, but the weakness is that a strong enough conclusion relating to the data cannot be established.&lt;br /&gt;

Mixed methods, action research. Luckner and Handley seek to understand and comprehend the pattern of effectiveness of the variety of teaching methods employed to children that are DHH. The study comprised of a 42 span of research from peer reviewed journals to make a table of statistically significant methods for teaching children that are DHH. The studies have found five elements that have been identified for at least a tentatively based science approach to reading. Luckner admits there are other methods of teaching to DHH children that do not utilize a phonological approach to reading – with minimal success. Exploring the variety of other options in light of phonological comprehension, Luckner says that the modifications to phonological comprehension to address the remedial issues of the child are also possible. A strength to this study is that it is a comprehensive mixed methods approach. It utilizes the best of quantitative and qualitative studies and structures them into a table of data. A weakness of this data is that there is no statistically significant data to indicate one method of instruction is superior over the other.&lt;br /&gt;
John L. Luckner, &amp;amp; Christine Cooke. (2010). A Summary of the Vocabulary Research With Students Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. American Annals of the Deaf, 155(1), 38-67. doi:10.1353/aad.0.0129&lt;br /&gt;
Mixed methods, action research. Luckner and Cooke create a synthesis of data to examine the relationships between children that are DHH, their reduced capacity for word knowledge lexicon, and the teaching methods employed to reduce the impact that being DHH has for a child, as there is a significant lack of scientifically driven data as to which reading instruction has statistically significant data for children that are DHH. The results are that Luckner and Cooke notice a lack of systematic inquiry within the set of studies that provide intervention for the children with DHH. The interventions are also not utilized in a variety of other samples of groups. Luckner and Cooke also notes that the amount of statistically significant impact the positive interventions have had are considered small by the U.S. Department of Education. A strength of the study is that they use a national standard of statistically significant thresholds to indicate whether or not a study has impact. A weakness of this study is that it is only a synthesis of the data that already exists.&lt;br /&gt;
Narr, R. A. (2006). Teaching Phonological Awareness with Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students. TEACHING Exceptional Children, 38(4), 53-58. doi:10.1177/004005990603800408&lt;br /&gt;
Mixed methods action research. Narr synthesizes information from anecdotal and empirical sources in order to provide teachers and educators a deeper understanding of the issues relating to DHH children as well as teaching methods to employ to develop phonological awareness. Various strategies are suggested developed around the utilization of phonological awareness, quoting from various sources. Use of tactile/kinesthetic cues to make up for the deficiencies are suggested. Auditory cues are also suggested, for those that have residual hearing. A strength of this study is that it draws from various sources to make suggestions to educators. A weakness of this study is that it employs from anecdotal evidence in a few places. Anecdotal sources are in themselves not necessarily a weakness, but there is a perception of anecdotal evidence being limited in scope.&lt;br /&gt;
Scott, J. A., Goldberg, H., Connor, C. M., &amp;amp; Lederberg, A. R. (2019). Schooling Effects on Early Literacy Skills of Young Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children. American Annals of the Deaf, 163(5), 596-618. doi:10.1353/aad.2019.0005&lt;br /&gt;
Quantitative action research. Scott et al. provide research to determine whether or not early intervention practices for children that are DHH has a positive impact on the child’s ability to read. The catalyst for this research was that there was very little data and research regarding early intervention practices for DHH children whereas ample amount of information exists for children that are hearing. In this study children that are DHH are cross examined with children that are of normal hearing. In this study, identification of words and letters, phonological awareness, and vocabulary and whether or not schooling results in a positive impact for children. The results are that the effects are significant for even with children as early as 3 years old. The longitudinal study consisted of over three years with biannual testing. In all three aspects growth was noted, with an exception that vocabulary growth tending to drop off after the second year of schooling intervention. A strength of this analysis is that it is a mixed research approach that presents quantified information. A weakness of this approach is that the study is generalized. There is no definite data that indicates specifically what type of intervention results in the increased ability to read, only that the intervention does indeed result in a positive impact for children as well as children that are DHH.&lt;br /&gt;

Quantitative. Trezek seeks to understand the relationship between two of the five reading skills, phonemic awareness and phonics skills and reading comprehension in young children that are DHH. The study utilizes two reading curriculums, Reading Mastery I and Visual phonics, with the research question exploring if the curriculum being administered for one year, can quantitatively indicate an improvement in reading comprehension and word decoding? The research indicates that the original hypothesis being proved valid. That is, that the mean posttest score for the students being administered the curriculum being higher than the pretest. Also, testing through the Word Reading subtests indicates a statistically significant change. A strength of this study is that a specific curriculum was utilized, allowing for greater validity for the study to be replicated. A weakness of this curriculum was that a control group was not utilized. Furthermore, there was a lack of comparison from the curriculum used and other similar curriculums that are designed for children that are DHH.&lt;br /&gt;
Trezek, B. J., Wang, Y., Woods, D. G., Gampp, T. L., &amp;amp; Paul, P. V. (2007). Using Visual Phonics to Supplement Beginning Reading Instruction for Students Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education, 12(3), 373-384. doi:10.1093/deafed/enm014&lt;br /&gt;
Quantitative research. Trezek et al. seek to further expand on the existing data of the curriculum Visual Phonics to indicate whether or not it has significance of impact on kindergarten and first grade children that are DHH. Visual phonics was used as a supplement to the curriculum in addition to what was being taught to the children that are DHH. One year of instruction was given to the kindergarten and first graders. The results indicate a statistically significant increase in post test scores. This study is in line with previous studies relating to the Visual Phonics program. Previous studies also indicate a larger increase in pretest and posttest abilities of the learners after one year of implementation of the curriculum. A strength of this study is that it seeks to build on the understanding of previous studies relating to the Visual Phonics program. A weakness the study is that there was no comparison group available for control in this study.&lt;br /&gt;
Wang, Y., Spychala, H., Harris, R. S., &amp;amp; Oetting, T. L. (2013). The Effectiveness of a Phonics-Based Early Intervention for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Preschool Children and Its Possible Impact on Reading Skills in Elementary School: A Case Study. American Annals of the Deaf, 158(2), 107-120. doi:10.1353/aad.2013.0021&lt;br /&gt;
Mixed methods. A research study was conducted to discover if a 40-50-week intervention would result in an increase of scores for kindergarteners and first graders and to also discover if those results would subsist throughout school. Improvement was noted in all three of the students, despite the differences in difficulty of hearing among the three students, with the ability to sustain and improve those skills. Also, to note was a significant amount of avoidance behavior when intervention first occurred in relationship to sound-based tasks. This should be understandable as the DHH child has had a history of negative experiences of being unable to perform tasks due to his or her reading ability. A strength to this is that because only three children were utilized in the study, the researchers and educators were able to focus their attention entirely on the three children to increase reading ability. But this same strength is also a weakness. There were only three children so there was no ability for generalized implications to a greater population.&lt;br /&gt;
Research Problem Statement&lt;br /&gt;
Research is conducted to determine whether phonetic based learning contributes directly to the increased ability of a child with DHH to read. DHH children are most certainly underprivileged regarding the lack of options to learn reading ability, as most of learning to read is acquired naturally through phonological awareness that children with normal hearing can utilize. The studies indicate a trend towards the ability to overcome the challenges of a child that is DHH by utilizing the same phonological awareness through creative means. A curriculum that emphasizes phonological awareness shows quantitative impact. Yet, there is no targeted curriculum that utilizes phonological based curriculums for specifically children that are DHH.&lt;br /&gt;
Relation of Research Problem to Professional Setting&lt;br /&gt;
I want to start a child care with the emphasis on reading, which is why I am enrolled in WGU. Of the children that enter my child care center, I may encounter a few children that have DHH obstacles. It is encouraging to know that the fundamentals are still the same: children acquire phonological awareness naturally. DHH children can also acquire that skill, if there are methods utilized to work around the obstacles they face in relation to their hearing.&lt;br /&gt;
Benefits of the Literature Search and Annotated Bibliography&lt;br /&gt;
The benefit to this is that I am able to search for numerous articles of quality that relate to my research topic. A literature search allows me to begin to compile necessary information to make a correct judgement of a topic I am exploring. Annotated bibliographies allow me to organize the information that I’ve compiled into a logical format that gives me a short and brief conclusion of each of the research studies that I have employed in my research topic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Organization Description&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of this organization is the Saving Service. This organization was created in 1700, but the modern form of the organization was created in 1910. Prior to 1910, the Saving Service was multiple agencies. One agency was designed to collect revenues by means of customs duties through naval routes, and another was designed to save shipwrecked sailors and passengers. Because the Saving Service predated the Anglican Navy by eight years, the pre-modern Saving Service was involved in a multitude of duties, from carrying mail to combating piracy. By the time of its modern inception in 1910, the Saving Service became one of the six military services of the Anglican States. This organization has been involved in every war of the Anglican States from 1700 to the current War in Zimbabweland. It currently employs around 55,000 employees and resides under the Anglican State of Household Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization is a federal agency, so it is neither a non-profit nor a for-profit organization. The core values of this organization are honor, respect, and devotion to duty. The mission of the Saving Service is to act as a military service when needed and to serve the people of the Anglican States through means of search and rescue, lifesaving, coastal waterway maintenance, drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, ice breaking, aids to navigation, environmental protection, and fishery inspection. These services are fit into three roles: maritime safety, maritime security, and maritime stewardship. There are no financial goals of the Saving Service because it is a federal branch of the Anglican States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership Practices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leader’s title is Naval Officer. His name is Mr. Johnny Appleseed. He is not the CEO of the organization. He is instead the chief in command for the naval unit of the Saving Station named Saving Station Meridian. Saving Station Meridian is a small station located approximately one hour south of Largeville, a very busy port city south of the Anglican States. Under Mr. Appleseed’s command are four naval vessels. He oversees the engineering aspect for all four ships. The engineering officers of each boat report to Mr. Appleseed any and all discrepancies relating to engineering and maintenance. Furthermore, Mr. Appleseed oversees a crew of 20 people. This crew of 20 is identified as Naval Engineering of Saving Station Meridian. These 20 people are tasked with the monthly maintenance of the four vessels. They audit maintenance logs through the computer and ensure that maintenance is complied with. Furthermore, Naval Engineering resides on standby in case a naval vessel were to experience unexpected engineering error or casualty. These 20 people are skilled in welding, electrical work, and mechanical proficiency. Any problems the crew of the four vessels cannot resolve gets passed to the Naval Engineering crew. In summary, Mr. Appleseed oversees four naval vessels as well as a crew of 20 that report directly to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Leadership Practices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first leadership practice is that Mr. Appleseed will keep his door open during workday. The only time that he keeps his door closed is when he is in a private meeting with an individual or if administrative counseling is done. Mr. Appleseed enjoys the closeness of proximity between himself and his subordinates, as he will joke with his subordinates as he walks between his office to other parts of the base. Because of this, sometimes he will hear about troubles his subordinates have. For example, as he was walking from his office to the bathroom, he overheard one of his subordinates confessing to another subordinate that he was involved in an abusive relationship and that he was the one being abused. Because of that, Mr. Appleseed approached the two having the conversation, and Mr. Appleseed arranged for a place for the person being abused to stay until situations would change. Although Mr. Appleseed may have to experience distractions during the day as he would hear all manner of sorts of conversation, he still keeps his door open to ensure he is aware of any trouble that may be brewing within his crew of subordinates. This is his way to contribute to the “honor” value of his organization. He treats his subordinates with respect despite the large difference in organizational level between him and his subordinates. He is not above being considerate and concerned for the day to day needs of his employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second leadership practice is that Mr. Appleseed requires all his subordinates to meet with him in the conference room at 0700. During this time, he gives what is called a “pass-down” where he announces upcoming events at Saving Station Meridian and if any, casualties relating to the four naval vessels that may have happened in between yesterday’s meeting and the current morning’s meeting. This meeting also gives an opportunity for his subordinates to also pass on information that they may have to others or to Mr. Appleseed. Fliers or physical copies of information are also placed in the middle of the desk in the meeting room so that others can have information to look through or to take home for themselves. Mr. Appleseed is practicing the “respect” value of his organization. He practices respect by ensuring his subordinates have an opportunity to speak during this time period and to share whatever information that can be useful to the crew. This form of respect is the respect of the opinions of others. Members can share whatever they’d like at this point of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third leadership practice Mr. Appleseed takes is that he will spend the weekends at a subordinate’s house if the subordinate needs help with electrical work. Before Mr. Appleseed was an officer in the Saving Service, he was a general day laborer for construction before becoming a master electrician. Because of this, Mr. Appleseed is relatively experienced with construction and housing maintenance. Mr. Appleseed one volunteered over 150 hours to a subordinate’s house because the subordinate’s house was flooded during a major hurricane. The wiring had to be redone and Mr. Appleseed donated over 10,000 dollars in service charge for free to his subordinate. Mr. Appleseed had also fixed a leaky spout in a subordinate’s house because it would require her to go to the roof, she was pregnant, and her husband had a form of a disability to prevent her or him from climbing onto the house. He invited the majority of crew to come by to help and a few came by to help him to fix the spout. This practice is related to the “devotion to duty” value of the organization. Mr. Appleseed is devoted to his duty, even to the point of practicing his duty over weekends where he is not required to work. Because this organization is a military organization, there is a certain expectation to watch for and to be concerned for the safety and well-being of your coworkers. Mr. Appleseed demonstrates this by volunteering his skills to the rebuilding of homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of Current Leader on Culture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Appleseed has positively contributed to the organization’s culture. There is a consensus that people have on others. Usually, a person’s reputation is based on the general consensus that others have on that person. In this case, the general consensus of Mr. Appleseed is overwhelmingly positive. It is not uncommon for a person to have mostly general positive consensus with a few negative remarks sprinkled throughout the population. However, at Saving Station Meridian, there was not a single negative remark said about Mr. Appleseed. Mr. Appleseed is a prime example of what a Saving Station member seeks to be. The first example of this is the concern Mr. Appleseed has for his subordinates. Mr. Appleseed overheard a conversation and instead of ignoring it Mr. Appleseed went out of his way to try to find a solution for that service member. Mr. Appleseed decided he would find a place for that service member to stay until things could improve or until that service member found a solution to the problem. This service member likely would not have spoken to anyone else about the situation. Mr. Appleseed utilized that opportunity to help someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Mr. Appleseed contributed nearly 150 hours of electrical work to a service member’s house. Mr. Appleseed simply went to the service member’s house, asked to help, and contributed electrical work to that service member. Nearly 10,000 dollars of work was done, and Mr. Appleseed, being a master electrician, never asked for a dime of that money. Furthermore, Mr. Appleseed never talked about the work he did for his subordinate. In fact, the fact that he asked for no money was kept a secret until sometime afterward when the subordinate that had the electrical work done had casually mentioned it. Mr. Appleseed’s subordinates only knew that Mr. Appleseed was working at the service member’s house because other subordinates had also volunteered to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Appleseed was consistently being recognized by his superiors. His superiors were aware of the organizational climate that Mr. Appleseed was positively contributing towards. Mr. Appleseed encouraged others through his own action a life of integrity, respect for others, and service to others. Hardly anyone could ever say Mr. Appleseed engaged in gossip for the sake of gossip. And hardly anyone could ever say Mr. Appleseed was not fair. The total time invested by Mr. Appleseed’s volunteer work is enough to point out the positive contribution Mr. Appleseed has made towards the organization. The Saving Service’s core values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty can be summed up by Mr. Appleseed’s contributions, who is a 24-year member of this organization. Many service members of the Saving Service look up to Mr. Appleseed as an example of a promising career in the Saving Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWOT Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first current strength of the organization is that it offers a standout edge to other industries in its employee benefits. The Saving Service has a health insurance coverage plan that is incomparable to the private sector. This includes near total coverage with exactly zero dollars in co-pay costs. On top of this benefit, the Saving Service has a pension plan for employees that fulfill a 20-year career. This pension plan is half of your base pay for the rest of your life, as well as including the health insurance coverage one held during the service member’s career life. This list of benefits is without competitor. No private industry can hold a candle to the employee benefits one holds as a federal employee of the Anglican State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second current strength is that barring performance related to the employee; it is very difficult to be removed from service as a member of the Saving Service. Federal employment does not experience employee layoff like a private industry might. Both profit and non-profit employees survive off the bottom line of an organization’s financial reports. Because of this, both profit and non-profit employees must perform and are often at risk of layoff as a result of economic situations greater than themselves. Because federal employees are employed by the federal government of the Anglican States, the salary for federal employees is paid for by the taxed income of the citizen of the Anglican States. This means that even during economic recession a federal employee is mostly guaranteed employment. This employment stability allows for the organization to boast to any would-be employee: “Work for us and never worry about being laid off”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first weakness of the Saving Service is that because the organization boast a giant list of employee benefits, it is susceptible to attracting people that join the organization solely for the benefits listed above. Most organizations, including the Saving Service, have core values by which it expects each of its employees to uphold. The problem herein lies that the core values are repeated by the employees while the allegiance to the organization lies within its benefits instead of its core values. This means that you have employees that are performing at the level necessary to maintain employment and to maintain those benefits. And because it is difficult to measure which employee joins as a result of the benefits and which employees would stay in the service if those same benefits were not offered to the employee, it is a matter of individual discretion to know which employees truly believe in the core values of the Saving Service and which employees are simply along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second weakness would be that, barring extreme examples, since it is difficult for federal employees to be fired, there lies no inherent pressure to perform at levels necessary to innovate and to progress the institution. It is not uncommon in the Saving Service for individuals to begin to “relax” when they’ve reached a certain number of years of employment with the Saving Service. This is because one, virtually it is nigh impossible to be fired and two, since they’ve reached a certain paygrade, this offers the individual further security since there are less people at the higher paygrades to report to and therefore, more discretion and less oversight. It is also not uncommon for people to complain about their unhappiness with the Saving Service. They do not quit and they will not be fired because the risk of losing their pension after 20 years is too great a time investment and second, federal employment is a path of considerably less friction than to the perils of a private sector job where employment is not guaranteed even if one were a stellar performer. This sort of dynamic can result in organizations filled to the brim with unhappy people that are self-seeking. They are in it for the benefits and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first opportunity would be to leverage the overwhelmingly positive public image the Saving Service has with the general tax-paying public. Other military services invest heavily in marketing and advertising to attract bright employees. The Saving Service, for some reason, does not. In fact, if one were to ask what the public thought of what the Saving Service did, they would be mostly vague or met with empty expressions. Many people are not even aware that the Saving Service is a military branch, let alone are aware of the myriad of missions the Saving Service engages in. Since most of the time it can be assumed that most people associate the Saving Service with handsome rescue swimmers jumping out of helicopters to save stranded sailors or residents of flooded homes, this is a positive strength of the organization to utilize to attract the best and brightest of civilians. The Saving Service can advertise that it is a humanitarian branch of the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second opportunity would be that the Saving Service can utilize the positive public image to request a greater discretionary budget at the request of the Budget ministry. The Saving Service is not like a profit or non-profit organization. The Saving Service must annually submit a budget request to the Budget ministry and hope that it is approved. Because the Saving Service now is currently in positive light of the public view, it can leverage that perspective to requesting a larger budget to expand its mission abroad the Anglican States. Currently, the Saving Service operates with approximately 55,000 employees. This is approximately the size of the police force of Anglican York City, the largest city in the Anglican States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first threat would be that the Saving Service is in danger of being lost to sociological trends. The trends of employees indicate that the next generation of employees are not as interested in the lifestyle of the military service. Current employees no longer expect organizational loyalty and according to trends, neither do employers. Nearly three decades ago it is not uncommon for a person to join one organization and to reside until retirement. Now it is not uncommon for employees to change jobs multiple times over their lives. Organizational loyalty is a fast expiring concept to modern workers. Secondly, the military service lifestyle demands a constant attachment to the job. Military service members are always on-call. This means that service members can be recalled back to base at any reason. Current employees enjoy and cherish a clear and distinct separation from work and pleasure. They do not wish to be tied to the organization’s needs once the workday has expired. This provides a giant challenge to attract the best and brightest employees to the Saving Service, which still adheres to a militaristic work and life schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last threat would be that the organization is at risk of backsliding. Government organizations are famous for their slow march toward progress. In fact, government organizations are famous for their resistance to change. On average it takes a few years for projects to be completed within the Saving Service. This is because of the military organizational structure that exists within the Saving Service. The military organizational structure that exists was implemented not without reason. When in times of war or chaos, the military organizational structure, or chain of command existed to give a clear direction to the question that exists within every organization: “Who’s in charge here?”. Such a chain of command is necessary in times of war, where it was not guaranteed that your boss today would be your boss tomorrow. However, in times of peace and relaxed standards, responsibility is difficult to muster within such a structure since one man can say to another, “I told my subordinate to do it, and he didn’t do it”. Then in this case while it may be easier to determine who is clearly at fault, it is still a resource intensive process to discover the causes and to determine who is clearly to blame. In such an environment, progress and innovation is seen by members of the organization with suspicion. In an organization as old as the Saving Service, nearly 250 years old, certain members will reject change and progress as an inherently “bad thing” because members are used to processes being as they were and not as what they could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership Evaluation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first strength of Mr. Appleseed is that he encourages others to follow his example by focusing on serving the needs of others. This is a key tenet of servant leadership. (Kiker, Callahan, &amp;amp; Kiker, 2019) Mr. Appleseed by no means needs to spend his weekends on a subordinate’s house to rewire that person’s house. But Mr. Appleseed focuses on the needs of his servants. This aspect allows Mr. Appleseed to serve as an example of performing cooperative and helpful behavior. (2019) Servant leadership is a process of leadership that encourages genuine concern and consideration for one’s followers. (2019) Servant leadership is based on the theory that if you can help others with their needs, they will in turn contribute to a greater organizational culture and achievement. (2019) Mr. Appleseed simply does not tell others to volunteer hours outside of workdays. He instead models that behavior by committing himself to that action, providing his followers with key behaviors to model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strength of Mr. Appleseed is that he is observant in determining what each skill of his subordinates are. In doing so Mr. Appleseed can place key employees in areas that can benefit maximally by having a skilled employee at that position. This is because servant leaders focus on placing individuals in positions where such individuals can grow intrinsically and professionally. (2019) When an employee is placed in an area of growth, that employee also grows in job satisfaction and job commitment. (2019) This strength is in part because Mr. Appleseed is constantly listening to the concerns of his employees. Just as earlier described, Mr. Appleseed found a place for a subordinate to stay because that subordinate was experience domestic abuse. An employee that is being abused in his or her house tends to bring diminished performance to the workplace. Mr. Appleseed placed that employee in a safe place to stay simply because Mr. Appleseed was observant enough to listen to a conversation his subordinate would not have had with Mr. Appleseed if Mr. Appleseed had not been listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third strength of Mr. Appleseed is that he always pushed for his employees to further their development professionally and personally. Mr. Appleseed always pushed for college for his subordinates if they were found to be sitting around the office. Mr. Appleseed pointed out that if you had time to sit around, you had time to work on some form of professional development. But despite his strong opinions on the subject, Mr. Appleseed never forced anyone to engage in professional development. He always utilized the power of persuasion. Mr. Appleseed never thought to try to win an argument. He would only mention it day after day in hopes that some form of persuasive argument would lean in favor of his subordinate to give into to take a college class online or to develop professionally as a trade worker. Mr. Appleseed also asked his employees to give monthly training on certain topics believing that doing so would encourage the employees a chance to develop in public speaking as well as in the area of research for the topic needing to be discussed. Nothing was ever asked of his subordinates by Mr. Appleseed. He always resorted to persuasion. This is a trait of servant leadership. (2019) This persuasion is also known as providing direction. (2019) Mr. Appleseed was deeply concerned for his subordinates, knowing that someday these men and women would leave the Saving Service, so Mr. Appleseed always tried to ensure that his subordinates had skills to pick up after once leaving the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first weakness of Mr. Appleseed’s leadership is that Mr. Appleseed is a giant figure to look up to. Although Mr. Appleseed continued to lead by example, there were followers in his group that felt that they could not reach those standards by which Mr. Appleseed held for himself. Mr. Appleseed was a considerably accomplished man. He had reached a high rank of warrant officer and had a myriad of awards and commendations given to him throughout his service life at the Saving Service. Mr. Appleseed likely did not think twice to contributing 150 hours to rewire a subordinate’s house, but others may be thought twice before considering investing so many hours to helping a person. This sort of action may have led others to statistically be unlikely to take up the role of leadership as seeing Mr. Appleseed in action may have caused some of his followers to sulk feeling they are not up to the challenge to follow in Mr. Appleseed’s example of leadership. (Lacroix &amp;amp; Pircher Verdorfer, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second weakness of Mr. Appleseed’s leadership is that his style of leadership, approximately servant leadership, is that the traits of his and servant leadership’s definition of servant leadership are typically associated with female characteristics. (Kiker, Callahan, &amp;amp; Kiker, 2019) Mr. Appleseed’s idea of care and concern for his subordinates stood in stark contrast to the more traditionally masculine concepts of leadership, i.e. Authoritative. (2019) Because of this, he may have caused some subordinates to feel uncomfortable to follow Mr. Appleseed’s leadership example because of a concern that they may be viewed as effeminate. This concern is not without standing in an organization that was traditionally exclusive to males and still carries a stigma and pride in being “traditionally masculine”. For his female subordinates, they may have to carry the stigma of being a female and engaging in servant leadership. In servant leadership, the positive effect of servant leadership with female leaders was lower than for males. (2019) Perhaps because of the expected view that women should naturally be servant leaders that the effect of servant leadership is lost on more followers. It is not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a third weakness of Mr. Appleseed’s leadership as a servant leader is that there is a statistically significant correlation between the effectiveness of servant leadership by the leader and its effect on followers if the followers are engaging in core-self evaluations. (Lacroix &amp;amp; Pircher Verdorfer, 2017) This means that followers must also engage in a process of self-learning and development for servant leadership to maximize its benefits on the followers. Mr. Appleseed always pushed for his subordinates to engage in professional and personal development. That opportunity, however, was taken only by a few of his subordinates. That is, only a few of his subordinates took college classes online while they had an opportunity to do so. Most of them enjoyed spending time on their phones to pass the time instead. There is a saying, “you can only lead a horse to water”. In Mr. Appleseed’s example, he can only encourage and hope to persuade his subordinates to take advantage of taking classes online at work. Because of the obstacles required for completing a college degree, most of his subordinates did not take college classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first recommendation for Mr. Appleseed would be to continue to rely on persuasion instead of charisma to encourage followers. A horse cannot be forced to drink and only led to drink. A servant leader needs to develop his or her spiritual character. (Sendjaya, Eva, Butar Butar, Robin, &amp;amp; Castles, 2017) Greenleaf, one of the founding fathers of servant leadership, indicate that spiritual character and humility were the source of a servant leader’s charisma. (2017) That is, a servant leader can “exemplify spirituality” by “nurturing in their followers” a greater sense of purpose. (2017) In our world now there is a great need and desire for purposeful work. Not all of us will be granted that privilege. However, a servant leader can be positioned to nurture a greater sense of purpose by encouraging followers to cultivate development for their own sake. It would be recommended to engage in a spiritual activity, be it attending a worship service somewhere or spending time in nature with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second recommendation I would make would be to continue to develop relationships with his subordinates. While it may look good for an organization to boast of its achievements, people tend to recognize and remember people instead of the achievements. Part of the enjoyment we may get watching a documentary is not so much for the work of the person but rather to learn more about the person him or herself. Servant leadership is associated with greater organizational success and organizational citizenship behavior. (Kiker, Callahan, &amp;amp; Kiker, 2019) Servant leadership promotes growth of an organization by catering to the individual. (2019) What is important then is to cultivate in each relationship a deeper sense of purpose and identity in each subordinate. It could be recommended that Mr. Appleseed organize events to where he hosts gatherings at his house or spend more time with his coworkers outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third recommendation to Mr. Appleseed would be to foster a work environment where employees do not feel pressure to avoid mistakes and are instead confident in their work ability. Stand behind their achievements and failures and empower employees to make decisions. These experiences, “in turn, likely convey to followers a sense of control and influence over outcomes (i.e., locus of control), helping them also to feel more calm and secure in challenging situations (i.e., emotional stability).” (Lacroix &amp;amp; Pircher Verdorfer, 2017) Another aspect of servant leadership is to encourage growth in the areas of professional development. A good indicator of whether Mr. Appleseed is achieving servant leadership is by looking at his subordinates. Are they growing professionally? Do they grow more confident in their abilities? And most importantly, are they also becoming servant leaders themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://getpoole.com/wgu%20final%20projects/2020/03/21/c200-managing-organizations-and-leading-people-task-1-my-clifton-strengths-analysis-and-utilization-of-hypothetical-smart-goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clifton Categorical Strengths&lt;br /&gt;
Context is the strength that indicates that I am interested in looking into the past to discover the solutions to the problems that are in the present. This strength drives me to build a framework of understanding in order to navigate through the present demands of the world. This is a strength that compels me to look to experts to find solutions. The Context strength can be maximized with a person that is future oriented. I may be able to utilize past cultural objects to imbue towards my followers to help them to be energized in current projects. A negative of this strength would be that I may be too rigid concerning change.&lt;br /&gt;
The Learner strength indicates that I am inclined to soaking up information and learning new skills because I find learning and discovering new facts as pleasurable. This strength drives me to improve on my own current skills because I feel challenged to address my own shortcomings. When addressing people, learning why a person may be motivated to act a certain way is how I gain satisfaction, giving me a well of information, facts, and data from which I add to my mental library.&lt;br /&gt;
The Input strength is that I enjoy the accumulation of facts and data. I am constantly thinking. I may enjoy learning new vocabulary or viewing all factors in a situation. This disadvantage can be that I could be inclined to draw data and information and then to horde the data or that I might begin to gather trivial data impulsively. Secondly, I must be able to utilize the data I collect for the advantage of others not merely for my own enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;
Individualization is the strength that indicates that I see people individually. I enjoy watching people and I like to observe differences between people to differentiate one person to another. Because I view people through individual differences, I tend to weigh my decisions carefully to consider all the variety of factors. I am likely to be logical and I can be trusted to be cautious with my decisions. Because I can see the unique characteristics of people, I can utilize that skill to help people to reach their goals by capitalizing on their abilities.&lt;br /&gt;
Deliberative strength indicates that I am inclined to break down complex processes to its smallest parts. I believe in taking my time with these processes. I may be slow to compliments because I am careful with my comments. I do not enjoy gossiping. I may be well suited for jobs that help me to give advice or to counsel others. I must be sure to convey that I am not being tentative with my actions but rather than I am carefully weighing the risks between each decision.&lt;br /&gt;
Three Positive Traits According to Transformational Leadership&lt;br /&gt;
A positive trait of the context strength is that I can utilize historical framework and context to provide my employees or followers a higher sense of morality or values to encourage ethical behavior. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp;amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) Looking toward the past to search for how people used to live or act can help me to give a vision to my organization in that I help them to see a progressive timeline of history in that we can look to the past to make the future a better place to be.&lt;br /&gt;
Utilizing individualization, I can utilize transformational leadership to support my people to become better people morally. I view that everyone is one of a kind. This means that I view people as individuals with unique talents and abilities that can be driven to push for higher organizational goals. Knowing how each of my followers operates based on their upbringing, how they view the world, themselves, and others, can help me to drive their ability further.&lt;br /&gt;
The input strength indicates that I am inclined to soak up knowledge to the best of my ability. I enjoy learning new things and that I like to then collect that data for later usage. Morality and ethics are not a static concept, but rather they are dynamic, or constantly changing in application and daily practical usage of the principals. This means that I can lead my organization by utilizing my input skill to raise new questions concerning ethics and morality and then to address those questions to my organization. (2013)&lt;br /&gt;
Three Weaknesses According to Transformational Leadership&lt;br /&gt;
The first weakness is through the individualization strength. I am encouraged to cultivate the traits of each of my individual followers. I am encouraged to take their skills, strengths, and goals as well as their differences from their cultural outlook and upbringing to bring the best out of them. Transformational leadership utilizes the approach of expressing the positive emotions to “serve as a charismatic role model to followers.” (Szu-han, Brent, &amp;amp; Fadel, 2019) In my approach to ensuring each individual is catered to in their own uniqueness, I may have to express positive emotions even when I am not feeling well, or, emotionally regulate (2019), in order to achieve follower success, which is costly to a leader because the leader becomes emotionally exhausted. (2019)&lt;br /&gt;
Second, my trait of being a learner may be helpful to my employees or followers because I am able to bring new skill sets to contribute to the organization due to my lifelong desire to learn and to grow simply for the sake and pleasure of learning. Because of that, I may have an easier time adapting to new standards or procedures that the company must utilize in order to stay competitive or to stay within regulation. As a transformational leader, I will have to convince my followers through persuasion that the new way of doing things is the right way to do things. This also contributes to being taxed with my finite mental resources. (2019) This may also cost time and money because transformational leaders must convince followers who may be committed to a routine because routines are comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the context strengths propel me to look toward the past to discover solutions to the present. This behavior can be attributed to transformational leadership as intellectual stimulation, or, the “stimulating followers’ creativity by challenging existing assumptions.” (2019) While the context strength explains that I may be looking to history to build existing framework, I may find that additional resources are expended in order to convey to followers that one, the historical lessons in which I find context have validity and two, that those historical facts are relevant to the building of the framework which is needed now to reach a solution.&lt;br /&gt;
All three of these weaknesses are based on the conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership. That is, that individuals behave in a manner that best aligns with their ability to reserve resources to their advantage. (2019) This theory holds that emotional exhaustion indicates a “depletion of resources.” (2019) The majority of transformational leadership has measured the effect the leadership theory has on the followers. The conservation of resources theory of transformational leadership indicates that while followers may benefit from transformational leadership and the above three Clifton Strengths attributes, my weaknesses of transformational leadership indicates that I may be inclined to a major loss of my own mental resources in order to push followers to greater productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
Three Actionable Steps&lt;br /&gt;
The first step I would utilize would be to point toward my context strength. Context helps me to look to past precedents to understand the present situation. Because I enjoy looking towards the past for solutions, I am in a prime position to share that desire also with my employees so that they would be inspired to reach their own vision about the organization. (Ömer, Mazlum, &amp;amp; İbrahim Sani, 2013) I could encourage them to look to past problems the company has had and how that problem was overcome, or if the problem was not overcome, how the problem looks like now having had some hindsight. I could utilize the past conflicts other companies have had to help my current organization to overcome similar situations or perhaps to even apply past solutions to our present problems.&lt;br /&gt;
Utilizing the individualization context, I could take the time to interview my followers or employees to find out what makes them unique. After interviewing those people, I could create a basic list of makes each of my colleague’s desire to grow and to learn, and what sort of goals they have for the future. With this knowledge, I can help my followers to become better people, a key concept of transformational leadership. (2013) During this process I could also explain to my colleagues that I view each people as a unique individual, and that I while I may seem to be partial to one person, I can try to explain that it is a justifiably right thing to treat each individually on a case-by-case basis, and that I own expectation is to treat all individuals as special and unique.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I can utilize my learner trait to help employees to achieve higher organizational goals that may not inherently be their own by instilling in the employees a sense of joy in learning new concepts. Transformational leadership is the process by which employees internalize the values and goals of the organization into their own. (2013) This can be utilized by sharing with my organization a love for learning. I could make learning about the ethics and values of the organization into a fun game or into a social event to encourage the process of internalization.&lt;br /&gt;
Two Short Term SMART Goals&lt;br /&gt;
The first SMART goal would be to improve my academic skills relating to writing and studying within a period of two weeks. Because I am currently enrolled in an MBA program, I want to be sure that I write clearly and that I utilize the time I spend studying effectively. I have determined that the best way improve my academic skill is to be sure to set a short-term goal of improving those skills. I have decided first to take an online course in academic writing and second, to learn to utilize the Pomodoro technique for studying through the online course. The Pomodoro technique is to measure 25 minutes of study time with a timer. When the timer ends, make a checkmark for completion of study time, take a 3-5-minute break utilizing the timer, and then repeat. After four Pomodoro sessions, I can then take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. After four checkmarks, I can then start from scratch again and reset my breaks.&lt;br /&gt;
The second SMART goal would be to be more well-read by the end of month. Specifically, I want to be able to read four more chapters of Edward Banfield’s “The Unheavenly City” as well as improving my vocabulary. Reading is a great way to develop comprehension skills. To a certain degree, I want to read novels that are above my reading and comprehension ability in order to challenge myself and to keep myself from becoming comfortable with complacency. Developing a reading program that utilizes learning vocabulary as well as consistent reading will help me to become more well-read by the end of the month as well as learning to utilize learning new vocabulary in order to become more well-read.&lt;br /&gt;
Specific Actions to Achieve SMART Goals&lt;br /&gt;
A specific goal I would like to achieve would be to develop my academic writing skills in order to increase my chances of writing clearly so that I can complete my MBA course. Specifically, I will attend and complete the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that is available on https://www.edx.org, enroll by January 29, and complete the course in two weeks, by working on the course for one hour every other day. I will measure my progress by tracking the hourly progress in a spreadsheet I have created separately. The final measure of the progress will be completion of the course by the end of a two-week progress. This is attainable to me because I have access to the internet and I also have an hour every other day to be able to contribute to the study of the course. Finally, because it is free to me, attending the course is not cost-prohibitive. This training is relevant to me because I am currently attending an MBA course which includes mostly written work. I must write clearly to make my points in order to achieve success in this program. The time frame of completion for this course will be the end of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, I will specifically utilize the Pomodoro technique in the studying of the “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course that I take on January 29. This technique utilizes studying for 25-minute intervals, making a physical checkmark for each interval, and then taking a 3-5-minute break between each interval. At the end of the fourth interval, I can then take a longer break of 15-30-minutes only to restart the entire cycle at the end of the longer break. This process is measurable because I can look at every checkmark that I’ve made for each study session. I can measure how long I am studying for by utilizing the timer. This is attainable because I simply utilize pen and paper to record my study interval checkmarks. A timer is also cheap to purchase. This is relevant to me because I am learning to become more efficient at academic writing. I will also need to learn how to better focus my time to studying. The Pomodoro technique encourages a conditioned and methodical approach to studying. The time frame of completion correlates to the end of my “Academic writing for clarity and meaning” course. By the end of the session I hope to better utilize the Pomodoro technique for my learning ability or to determine if the Pomodoro technique is not relevant to my studying style.&lt;br /&gt;
First, I would like to achieve reading four more chapters of The Unheavenly City: Revisited” by Edward Banfield by the end of February. It is measurable because I have allotted myself 30 minutes every other day to the reading of the book, so I am able to track my progress. It is attainable because I have the time available every other day to devote 30 minutes to reading the book. It is relevant to me because the Unheavenly City relates to sociological trends and as a result a future prediction of what cities and societies will look like in America. Looking at these problems in an academic perspective helps me to consider future solutions to present problems that ail American society. The time frame I have given myself to finish the four chapters is the end of February.&lt;br /&gt;
Secondly, I intend to download the Vocabulary.com app onto my phone. Then, before I read “The Unheavenly City”, I will utilize 10 minutes on top of my 30-minute reading session to playing vocabulary games on my phone. This 10-minute session will be a conditioning to associate two actions, reading “The Unheavenly City” and increasing my vocabulary with the stated goal to becoming more well-read. The Vocabulary.com app utilizes computer algorithms to cater vocabulary words to my skill level. Playing a game with vocabulary helps me to solidify my learning. This is measurable because the app will tell me how many times I’ve used the app including time and date usage. It is attainable because the vocabulary is learned in a fun manner. It is relevant to my goal of becoming more well-read because to become well-read is also to have a diverse vocabulary. This is also time bound because I will revise my goal after the end of the month of completing four chapters of “The Unheavenly City”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
PSY476&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case Description&lt;br /&gt;
    A. Demographic Description&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter is a 38-year-old male that has grown up in the United Kingdom. Culturally he appears to be of a middle-class background with both a Muggle and Wizarding upbringing. Both Harry Potter’s parents passed away at a young age so Harry Potter was raised by his aunt and uncle. His uncle, Vernon, was a junior executive at Grunnings, a drill-making company in Surrey, England. Harry Potter’s aunt, Petunia, went to London to become a typist before meeting Vernon and being married to him. Petunia is somewhat acquainted with the Muggle world, as Petunia’s sister, Harry’s mother, was a witch. Harry Potter is heterosexual. He is married to Ginny and has three children. He is currently employed by the Ministry of Magic as an auror. He has no stated religion of affiliation. He is a graduate of Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;
    B. Referral Method&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter was referred to us by The Ministry of Magic. Due to the level of work that Aurors tend to be involved in, the Ministry of Magic has decreed that all aurors be evaluated yearly by a trained counselor in order to determine the mental state of the individual. Harry Potter himself appears to have no opinion on the matter. He is very professional in his approach to his opinion.&lt;br /&gt;
    C. Appearance, Behavior, and Mental Status&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter wears glasses and has a scar on his forehead. His clothes appear to be clean but they look a little worn and creased in certain areas. Of particular note is Harry Potter’s hair, which looks like a comb would be defeated in attempting to groom it. Harry Potter appears to be distant in his communication, though not entirely unfriendly. He describes his situation and his background with a sort of professional demeanor, if not slightly distant. His gaze is intense and given his background, appears to be typical of an individual with historical trauma.&lt;br /&gt;
    D. History&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter has suffered from a form of post traumatic stress disorder as well as depression typical of those that have suffered that level of trauma. When I asked how long he’s experienced his feelings of depression he has replied “Always.” When asked how often he’s experienced those feelings he says “A bit.” When I pressed him for more details about the frequency of the symptoms, he says sometimes when he is ready for bed or when his head hurts. I ask him if the scar was the reason for his pain and he says “Probably.” I take note of his ambiguity in describing his situation.&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter’s parents were, according to him, very much in love when I asked him about his parents. This was before I knew that his parents had deceased from when he was a young boy. He tells me that when he was a young boy, he was taken into the care by an Albus Dumbledore, who had sought to bring him under the protection of Vernon and Petunia. Harry tells me that Vernon and Petunia did not like him very much, and he supposes that this is the result of Petunia being jealous of Harry’s mother, Lily, and therefore despising Harry because Harry also exhibited the same magical potential that Lily had. I asked if he lived with any siblings, or if Petunia and Vernon had any children that Harry had lived with, and Harry tells me that he has a cousin named Dudley. He also tells me that there was once a relative that also had passed away, who was named Sirius Black. This was Harry’s Godfather. His current family is his own, Ginny is his wife and they have three children, James, Albus, and Lily.&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter is somewhat of a celebrity in the Magical world. According to the Magical world, Harry Potter is “The Boy who Lived”. And as such, he is well known around the magical realm. Apart from this, Harry Potter manages to have a few close friends. They are, Ron and Hermione, Neville, and Hagrid. These friends have also been with Harry through many traumatic moments. When speaking about his friends it is obvious that Harry holds these relationships very dear to him. He also appears to be distant with the majority of his peers and coworkers. Harry seemed to be wanting to be left alone from the majority of his peers and coworkers, who appear to view Harry as some sort of saint or prophet. Harry’s original teachers viewed Harry in a very positive light, seeing the exceptional characteristics of Harry’s past and his present experience.&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry’s past academic achievement, though spotty here and there, appears to be held in high regard. Furthermore, his work as an Auror is, according to the Ministry of Magic, impeccable though at times unorthodox. Some of his superiors seem to suggest that Harry has a slight problem with authority though being unable to cite a concrete example of Harry’s unorthodox approach.&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry has been hospitalized many times in the past due to his passion in Quidditch as well as sustaining multiple injuries when Voldemort, a rogue wizard, attempted to take over the world. On top of that, there appears to be some form of substance abuse, as Harry mentions he’d taken a “Polyjuice Potion” but the effects of the drug are lost on the counselor. Though Harry says he does not suffer from eating and weight control, he mentions that sometimes he stays up at night thinking about the past and the friends and schoolmates he had lost.&lt;br /&gt;
    He does not appear to have any other counseling history as this is the first year that the Ministry of Magic has mandated a yearly diagnosis of the Aurors. Harry also mentioned that he thought it was strange that the Ministry of Magic would assign the counseling to Muggles, which I have learned that such a word is in reference to those that are without magical powers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multicultural Considerations&lt;br /&gt;
    Harry Potter has come from two different multicultural backgrounds. The first is that of the Muggle world. I am told that the word Muggle is used by the Wizarding world to describe a person that is not magically oriented. Upon further assessment, I am learning that Muggle itself is not a derogatory word but there do appear to be words to assign to a Muggle that is indeed derogatory. Harry is familiar with the cultural references of the Muggle world, but he does not appear to be up to date with current cultural events as he has spent the majority of his adult life in the Wizarding world. In the wizarding world, wizards are fascinated by how Muggles get along with their lives without the use of magic, for example how cars are powered by internal combustion as compared to the car being magically enchanted. Apparently, cars in the magical world can even fly. Though the common language between the Muggle and Magical world is equally English, there are words, like the world Muggle, that are used exclusively by the magical world. Therefore, Harry’s magical culture appears to be much more exclusive than that of the Muggle world. Apparently, most wizards and witches are assigned a wand, or a wand “selects” a wizard or a witch and that it is a unique imprint upon that witch or wizard that cannot be easily used by others. I have attempted to discover any parallel or equivalent concepts that exist in the Muggle world but yet such an attempt still escapes me. However, I have found that the magical world has a game known as Quidditch, which could possibly be similar to Cricket and football, both sports well known in the English portion of the Muggle world. From what I am told, Quidditch is a game that is played internationally, and I have found that football also is played internationally.&lt;br /&gt;
    This understanding of what magic is and how much it influences Harry’s world is potentially a problem and an obstacle of understanding for me. I am, according to this world, a Muggle. And that means that I’m just not inclined to magic in any sort of way. I was told by Harry that Petunia had sent a letter to Hogwarts, asking Albus Dumbledore if she could also attend the school along with Lilly and that Albus regretfully declined her request. Although I am completely oblivious to the magical underworking of Harry’s magical world, I am convinced that I will still be able to make a full evaluation of Harry’s mental state and to offer to him potential solutions to his situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial Assessment&lt;br /&gt;
    My assessment of Harry Potter is that he is a victim of post traumatic stress disorder. The events surrounding Harry Potter was what was called in the magical world, the Second Wizarding War, in which Voldemort makes his second attempted ascension to power. Harry Potter’s life dramatically changed when Harry’s parents were killed by Voldemort – they were fighting a war against Voldemort and because Harry was the child of James and Lily, active participants in the First Wizarding War, Harry was unwillingly brought into the conflict. His parents were killed and due to a strange circumstance, Harry was left alive, though he should have also died. There remains a mark on Harry’s forehead that is evident to the wizarding world – a mark that was left on Harry by one of the wizarding world’s most feared wizard of all time. This, though Harry finds out this history of his life later when he is accepted into Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is likely a large part of the reasons why he may feel symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, Harry was raised as a child by Vernon and Petunia, who made no attempt to hide their active disgust for Harry and his parents. Harry was also likely affected by the revealing of his past and his famous role, though unwittingly, of both the First and Second Wizarding War. Throughout his academic career Harry was a constant witness to death and destruction as well as the revealing of key figures of his life important to him to mostly be a lie and fabrication, though some of the lies being put in place in order to protect Harry. In the last academic year of his life at Hogwart’s, Harry is forced to encounter Voldemort and to defeat him, a no doubt large feat for a young boy his age. His many mentors and loved ones had passed away due to the destruction of the evil that Voldemort plotted, mainly the death of Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and Sirius Black. Harry furthermore had to struggle with the downtimes of his life when he would have to return back home to his Muggle caretakers, Vernon and Petunia, who would rather have pretended that he did not exist. Although Harry was able to keep in contact with his friends from Hogwarts, he was mostly kept in isolation. Speaking of this isolation, Harry had to deal with being a celebrity in a role that he played no active part in. He is known in the Wizarding World as “The Boy Who Lived”, and is reminded that he is known for being a boy that survived the terrible murder of his parents while he managed to escape, though without his own understanding of how he managed such a feat. During his career at Hogwarts, he is told that there is a man that was looking to kill him. This man, known as Sirius Black, is later revealed that Sirius was betrayed by minions of Voldemort and was actually in fact, a close friend of James and Lily and Harry Potter’s godfather. Time and time again things that Harry knew to be true regarding his circumstance and his life were found to be either untrue at all or that things were not exactly as they seemed. It is miraculous that Harry has survived through these emotionally stressful times and is still managing a somewhat normal life and career, evidenced in his stellar career as an Auror. However, it would appear to be that the First and Second Wizarding War left a large imprint on Harry Potter. Though he has not yet smiled with me, I am told that he is a loving father to Ginny, a woman he greatly loves, and is a caring father to his three children. His friends also know Harry to be a man with great courage though at times a bit intense, as I have personally experienced. His ambiguity describing his past with me and how he deals now with the past of his life conveys this sort of intensity. When I asked him if he disliked my probing of his questions he said, “Not really.” I looked at his portfolio and have found mention of a certain Rita Skeeter. Upon further evaluation I have found that this person had knowingly as a reporter and journalist spread untruthful statements about Harry, especially during a period known as the Triwizard Tournament, an incredibly dangerous game in which a young boy and friend of Harry Potter, Cedric Diggory, was killed. From this I can understand if he harbors any sense of distrust towards me.&lt;br /&gt;
    My hypothesis of Harry’s circumstance is that he is an individual with a traumatic past with multiple identity crises resulting from not knowing his parent’s true past until he became eligible to enter Hogwart’s as well as finding out that his so-called killer was in fact his godfather. I also assume that the Second Wizarding War left a traumatic imprint on him in the same manner soldiers experience when encountering war and having had his or her friends killed in combat, resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder. The goal for this counseling is to provide for him solutions for coping with the disorder especially during periods when he is alone or is reminiscing the past, as well as providing him tools to transition into his mid-life as a father and a husband and perhaps, to be a grandfather.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Counseling Models&lt;br /&gt;
    Adlerian therapy through the use of solution-focused brief therapy suggest the use of encouragement in order to facilitate change in an individual. (Watts &amp;amp; Pietrzak, 2000) First the counselor does this by changing the perception of the situation and allowing individuals to disengage from negative behaviors and actions. In essence, to change the “doing” and the “viewing” of the situation allows clients to change behavior. Then in doing so the counselor also seeks to extract resources or solutions (Watts &amp;amp; Pietrzak, 2000) for the client to apply to his or her own life. Wheeler, Kern, and Curlette in 1993 developed an adaptive lifestyle inventory based on Adlerian psychology. Taking this inventory would possibly help Harry to see quantitative data on his skills as a person that adapts and overcomes situations. (Stoltz, Wolff, Monroe, Farris, &amp;amp; Mazahreh, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
    If I am unable to establish rapport with Harry then my attempts at encouragement could be seen as shallow or that I am doing so with ulterior motives. Therefore, this model could have drawbacks if my relationship with Harry does not grow further or if I am not allowed enough time with Harry to establish that rapport.&lt;br /&gt;
    Person-centered therapy focuses on the ability to establish rapport with the client and to give full trust to the client that he or she can be empowered to change his or her own life. This process first starts with the emphatic approach to the client. (Glauser &amp;amp; Bozarth, 2001) This form of therapy does not have specific models of technique for a counselor to follow but rather emphasizes instead the wholly on the client. (Glauser &amp;amp; Bozarth, 2001) The drawback to this method is that this method may take time for Harry to choose to engage in the therapy.&lt;br /&gt;
    With existential therapy a counselor can advise the client to explore the present situation in which they find themselves and to take collaborative approaches to those situations. (Derrington, 1999) This is done by exploring the impact decisions have made on a client’s present situation and through that exploration to find new possible choices to move forward with. Harry could have used this form of therapy in order to find resolution in any potential “what-if” moments he’d had in his past. A drawback to this is if Harry finds those memories too painful to explore and to allow to resurface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theoretical Models&lt;br /&gt;
    A. Review Theoretical Models&lt;br /&gt;
    Adlerian psychology focuses on “meaning, goals, purposeful behavior, conscious action, belonging, and social interaction.” (Corey, 2016) It also emphasizes finding meaning in life and for the search for purpose in one’s own life as well as taking control over one’s own destiny, a theme unique to Adlerian therapy considering psychoanalytical approaches viewed that genetics and environment were deterministic on behavior of the person. (Corey, 2016) Existential therapy emphasizes what it means to be human and common thematic approaches common to all human life. (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, existentialism, like person-centered therapy, emphasizes the quality of the relationship between the therapist and client. These common human themes, such as the freedom of choice, is one of the basic conditions of human life that existentialism refers to with common human themes. (Corey, 2016) Person-centered therapy focuses on the quality of the relationship between the client and therapist, and believes that people have an innate drive towards self-direction. This form of therapy holds that the responsibility of the resolving of problems lies within the client. (Corey, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
    The strengths of the above three theoretical models may speak for themselves. Adlerian therapy emphasizes the challenging or the modifying of faulty assumptions or mistaken goals. Perhaps Harry feels responsible for the deaths of some of his close friends and feeling that he could have done something else or more in that moment to have prevented his friend’s death. Adlerian psychology would seek to correct that faulty assumption in that the therapist would attempt to convey to Harry that the events that transpired were on Harry’s part, the best that Harry could have done and that feeling responsible for the death of someone is a faulty assumption. The Adlerian therapist could provide Harry with a new “cognitive map” that would allow Harry to think more positively on his past. (Corey, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
    The downside to Adlerian therapy is that the relationship that I would need with Harry is that of a collaboration. At the moment it is yet unsure how much Harry will begin to trust me as a cooperative partner to help him to challenge those faulty assumptions. Part of this process begins by asking Harry to recollect early parts of his past. Harry may simply not feel that I am trustworthy enough for Harry to share some of those memories. Finally, a large portion of Adlerian theory still requires empirical data. (Corey, 2016) Therefore there may be an overlap in theory and application that is effective for Harry.&lt;br /&gt;
    Like Adlerian theory, existentialistic theory holds that behavior and genetics are not deterministic but rather than people have the choice and freedom to decide their lives. This approach encourages clients to “reflect on life, to recognize their range of alternatives, and to decide among them.” (Corey, 2016) Harry may feel a sense that his past has determined the course of his life through the events that took place that took his parent’s life. Both Adlerian and existential theories hold that the past is not a determiner of the future and present and that Harry can take actions to take control of his destiny by first accepting responsibility of his life. According to Van Duerzen, “existential counseling is not designed to “cure” people of illness in the tradition of the medical model.” (Corey, 2016) Instead, existential counseling focuses on the “client’s immediate, ongoing experience with the aim of helping them develop a greater presence in their quest for meaning and purpose.” (Corey, 2016) Harry will soon enter into another new stage of his life, that which holds the Second Wizarding War behind him and into a life which may closely be labelled as “a civilian life.” Here Harry, though he never offered himself up as a soldier must put past the life of a soldier and now wear the clothes of a civilian. As a therapist I can encourage Harry to find greater purpose in his life as he enters into a new life.&lt;br /&gt;
    A downside to this approach is that often times existential concepts are what might be best called “abstract.” (Corey, 2016) Those that are not philosophically minded may have a harder time grasping the principles of existentialism and may turn away from the therapy. (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, there is a larger burden of responsibility on the therapist, as “Existential therapists need to be wise and capable of profound and wide-ranging understanding of what it means to be human.” (Corey, 2016) Furthermore, “Authenticity is a cardinal characteristic of a competent existential practitioner, which is certainly more involved than mastering a body of knowledge and acquiring technical skills.” That is, do I myself have the depth of understanding of the human experience in order to fully engage Harry as a counselor? I have not experienced anywhere near the depth of his pain and struggle and can potentially find it difficult to understand Harry’s depth of emotional experience.&lt;br /&gt;
    Person-centered therapy has a main strength that may be a drawback depending on the client. The motivational factor for change lies in the client him or herself. In particular, “This belief in the client’s capacity for self-healing is in contrast with many theories that view the therapist’s techniques as the most powerful agents that lead to change.” (Corey, 2016) Harry Potter can be seen as a survivor. The numerous events that happened in his life is evident of that. Therefore, it can be said that a person-centered therapy can beneficial to Harry since he shows the same traits that humanistic and existential theories exemplify in a human.&lt;br /&gt;
    The downside to this is that if Harry Potter were to recede in his therapy or his will to continue on, it would become more difficult for the therapist to counsel Harry, seeing as nearly all of the theories above rely on the human’s intrinsic need to actualize. Adlerian psychology is the least humanistic of the three above theories but still relies on the client’s ability to move forward by his or her own will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Develop a Theoretical Orientation&lt;br /&gt;
The three approaches of theoretical models I’ve chosen greatly emphasize the relationship between the client and the counselor. The first method I would need to utilize is the establishing of rapport with Harry. Within the three frameworks I’ve chosen, I cannot provide Harry with any sort of support and counseling without the establishment of a relationship in which I view Harry with complete faith that he can overcome his issues and that I can encourage him to do so. So, the establishment of rapport would be my first step. My second step would be to approach his past with Adlerian framework. That is, to explore his past and the overcoming of his struggles, and to explain to him that Adlerian theory, in comparison to Freudian theory, was that Adler viewed that the past was not a deterministic factor in a person, but rather that the struggles and the overcoming of the struggles was what more defined a person. Then I would utilize the existential approach by encouraging Harry to explore the other options he could have taken, past and present in order to encourage him and remind him that he has a choice in the matter of his life and that there are basic themes in his life that are universal to all human life, in order that he might be more able to empathize with the fans of his in the magical world. Then, I would utilize a person-centered therapy in order to remind Harry that it is Harry that has the ability to change himself for the present and the future. Finally, I would have him take an adaptive inventory test based on the Adlerian framework in order that Harry might have some quantitative data to take him to share with his family members, providing further another platform to discuss and to potentially grow.&lt;/p&gt;

I will be presenting this information to high school students. From here onwards I will be writing as if I am speaking or presenting this information to high school students, so there will be a liberal use of “you” with the assumption that “you” are, a high school student. Therefore, if the information presented appears to be casual or informal, it is reminded to the reader that such casual use is the intended effect to cater to a high school audience that may have a difficult time with captured attention for prolonged series of time. It is with that intention that the author intends to write a little more casually, and a little less academically in terms of conveyance of language.&lt;br /&gt;
Romantic Relationships&lt;br /&gt;
There are three components of a healthy relationship. In order to understand those three components, I intend to explain to you all Robert Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love. This model will help you gain an understanding of relationships and how love fills and carries that relationship. It is my intention that you all walk away from this presentation with a firmer understanding of the potentials of love and how it might not be so much just about passion and attraction. That is, that you understand this information to provide you with the ability to live more fulfilling and promising lives through your relationships here and for the future. Since we are also talking about relationships later, I will be presenting information concerning family styles and structures. Perhaps this facilitates further understanding of where you’ve come from and how these relationships you will be finding yourself in will fit into the larger scheme of life.&lt;br /&gt;
Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love deals with, no surprise, three elements of love, all of which make up the broader portrait of love. These three elements are passion, intimacy, and commitment. (01) Let’s break down these three elements. Passion can be characterized by a strong desire to be with that person, constant thoughts about that person, and of course something which I’m sure you all are very well aware of, sexual excitement. (01) Intimacy can be described as the “sharing of one’s thoughts and feelings, as well as being vulnerable enough to reveal one’s true self.” (01) Commitment has to do with the decision “has decided to forego all other liaisons and live in union with the other person.” (01) That is, they live for each other. Now that the three elements of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love have been defined, we can begin to understand the second level of analysis of love. According to Sternberg, having more or less of these three elements can result in various forms of love. For you boys and girls, it would be like assembling your fantasy football team and with each configuration of players giving you different results for each team assembled. What I am attempting to convey to you all is that love is a complex process. To give you a further example of Sternberg’s application of his Triangular Theory of Love, relationships that are “high on passion and love on intimacy and commitment are called infatuation.” (01) Howe, author of “Marriages and Families in the 21st Century: A Bioecological Approach”, states that “infatuated couples have a strong physical attraction and are often together a lot of time but they don’t open up to share their secrets and they don’t decide to stop seeing other people to build a life together.” (01) While the latter part of this statement I did not find to be particularly true when I was younger and dating, I did find that many of the relationships I’ve experienced were relationships of infatuation. Perhaps you all have experienced something similar. An important aspect of this model is that you’re more closely able to identify the relationship style of what you may currently be in now or what you can theorize you’d be experiencing later in the future should you decide to date. Figure 1 explains the various combinations that you could achieve with the understanding that intimacy, passion, and commitment combine to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 (Howe, 2011)&lt;br /&gt;
Sternberg makes a further point with his theory. The types of love that are formed through two people are based on the different expectations people have. (01) Therefore, Sternberg makes a recommendation to communicate with a potential partner in order that your expectations are not incompatible with the person you have interest in. I think it is easy for you all to fall into a relationship merely because of one element of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love being present at the complete disregard for the other two. Perhaps I am making a broad generalization but I should think that most of you are high on the intimacy or passion element while being low on the commitment element. But that is my assumption. What Sternberg stresses is the need for communication between the two parties – you, and your lover. The reason for compatibility and incompatibility is what Sternberg calls a love story. (01) Sternberg says that love stories are created in our minds that serve as templates for what people expect in the expression of love and, according to Howe, how “we see ourselves ending up in a love relationship.” (01) Love stories are typically what one might expect. According to Howe, the most popular love stories are travel, gardening, and democratic government. Figure 2 conveys what typical love stories can consist of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 (Howe, 2011)&lt;br /&gt;
These stories are our expectations of what we see in ourselves and in our partners for love. Sternberg notes that the different love stories do not always equate into a negative result but that these stories provide points of thought for further communication for what each partner wants in his or her own expression of love. (01) It is on this basis of Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love that we can build three important components of a healthy romantic relationship. They are, according to Sternberg, the three elements of love, compatible love stories, and communication to each party what each is looking for.&lt;br /&gt;
Three Problems Commonly Faced by Married and Otherwise Committed Couples&lt;br /&gt;
I assume that the majority of you all are not yet married. If you are already married then I congratulate you. I also congratulate you if you are not yet married. But I assume that for the most part, the majority of you all will not have experienced these problems firsthand. But you may have seen these problems from your parents or other family members and friends. The first common problem experienced by married or committed couples is infidelity. That is, they cheat by involving themselves with affairs outside of the proposed committed relationship. There are a variety of factors that are involved but interestingly there also appears to be a biological cause for this behavior. (01) According to Howe, a study in Sweden has shown that a gene named allele 334 is associated with double the rate of distressed marriage of men with the gene present in expression. Women married to men with this gene expression were also unlikely to be happy or satisfied in the marriage. (01) While there is a biological aspect of this cause for infidelity, there is also a work place related cause for the behavior, as workplace related infidelity is becoming increasingly more common. (01) According to Howe, researchers have been able to predict boredom with marital dissatisfaction approximately 9 years into the marriage. (01)&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of fidelity, the second common problem is financial infidelity. Financial infidelity refers to the secret financial accounts and debts that a partner withholds from the other. (01) According to Howe, “Our relationships with money tell a lot about our emotional lives, our family history, and our sense of identity. The way we handle money tells people about our priorities and those things we value most.” (01) That is then, you can see the importance of the role that money plays in a relationship, especially a committed or married relationship. Since this group I am talking to is young, you may not already have a large amount of debt. Considering this position, I hope to encourage you all to carefully consider what sort of obligations you will be willing to incur. College debt is a large amount of debt and may be a point of stress for your future relationships. I urge you all to carefully count the costs and decide for yourselves if the traditional form of college is the way for you, despite the pressure to conform and to attend college the same way as the majority of us Americans do. Even financial independence appears to have negative implications for marriages. (01) According to Howe, Loftus states that “money reflects the type of intimacy a person is willing to engage in.” (01) Because there exists a relationship between money and intimacy, Howe suggests the use of communication to “discuss financial status and their spending and saving philosophies before they commit…” (01) Are you all beginning to see the importance of the role that money plays in your future relationships?&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the third common problem with marriage and committed relationships is perception. Carrere et. al. (2000) found “unrealistic perceptual biases in newlyweds were key predictors of marital dissolution five years later.” (01) Remember what we learned about Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love. People come with preexisting ideas of what love ought to be. According to Sternberg it was each person’s love story. According to Howe, “partners enter into a relationship with preexisting working internal models and perceptual tendencies.” (01) Evidently, these internal models or preexisting perceptions of what the relationship ought to be is such a strong element of a marriage or committed relationship, it can be accurately predicted up to 80% to 90% accuracy whether or not the marriage or committed relationship will continue. (01) Part of this reason is the perceptual biases are difficult to change. (01) Another part has to do with the partner’s ability to handle ambiguity and anxiety in a positive manner. (01) This arises from having grown up in secure attachments to caregivers. According to Howe, securely attached couples engage in “positive conflict resolution, have reality-based perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses in themselves and their partners, are good at emotion-regulation skills, and have excellent self-insight.” (01)&lt;br /&gt;
Society and Societal Structures Create or Contribute to the Three Problems Discussed Earlier&lt;br /&gt;
So, what are some societal factors that contribute to these common marital problems? Concerning infidelity, and specifically infidelity in the workplace, both partners are increasingly likely to go and work. That is a significant amount of time that both partners are away from each other and interacting with other members of their peers. According to Howe, at the work place people “tend to dress more nicely, think before they talk, and be on their best manners while at work.” (01) Therefore it is not a far stretch of the imagination to consider why the workplace could be a form of an artificial environment in which you or your partner may be mislead to think that the work place environment is reality. Howe continues further, that according to Tsapelas, Aron, and Orbuch that boredom was also an indicator of whether or not a marriage would produce marital dissatisfaction approximately nine years into the marriage. (01) Boredom may also be a common symptom of the modern life. Despite the rigorous pressures to conform, to meet work standards, or in your case, academic standards, work life balance, as well as later in life when you begin to juggle debts and mortgages, there is still no doubt a sense of comfortability with life. Although the majority of you all may be quite busy with your time, there still is plenty of downtime and from what I can tell it would appear that the majority of you all spend that downtime on your phones or consuming media. There appears to be in our society a pervading sense of boredom and loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;
This loneliness could also lead to the frivolous spending of money. Financial infidelity has to do with the secret spending and holding of separate accounts from their partners. Boredom could be a large factor in the role of that spending. Possibly even so that the boredom of their partner causes the spending in a secretive and guilty manner. Howe points out that the conflict itself is not the problem. But rather that the problems “lie in unhealthy processes that lead to conflicts being unresolved or handled in ineffective ways.” (01) So you all can see that the potential that financial spending can have on a marital or committed relationship. That is that, some of us may be inclined to spend our way out of boredom or the unfulfilled needs that we may have. Furthermore, access to credit has never before been easier. It only takes a single application to be approved for an amount of money that you or I may be financial incapable of being able to afford. And since credit has been made so widely available and the skills to manage this incredibly powerful tool hardly taught, it can be no large stretch of the imagination why credit is largely misused and abused. Furthermore, with the ease of credit people are now more likely to walk into new relationships already with debt from a mortgage, automobile loan, and college loans.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, for all of the information that has now been so readily available to us through our smart devices, according to my own intuition, there is very little information being accessed regarding personality styles, love stories, and understanding of one’s own personality and perceptions regarding love and relationships. According to my own intuition, the majority of information being consumed by our society is media related. So, although information like discussed earlier concerning Sternberg’s love theories and potential reasons for the common martial problems, it could be that this information is not being accessed. Although according to Howe, people that grow up in secure attachments to caregivers tend to have the positive traits necessary to maintain healthy relationships, it would appear to be to me that these traits can potentially be taught over time. What then of the availability of such skills? Likely it would be a time resource intensive process and funds would need to be readily available for couples willing to undergo the class. And it should be obvious that many couples are already facing many obstacles to attending the class, such as financial and time obligations needing to be overcome. Furthermore, couples would need to admit that a problem exists, and that can also be a major obstacle. Societally, as far as the author can tell, there are no taboos on couples that refuse to seek help for their marital commitment. In fact, our society may have a sort of “mind your own business” attitude concerning the marital problems of their neighbors or relatives.&lt;br /&gt;
Three Social-Societal Supports&lt;br /&gt;
To help you to generate ideas on how you can utilize resources or to take advantage of the information that is being provided to you today, I have proposed three separate potential supports to help you along with your future or current relationships. First, I propose that spouses be allowed to enter into the workplace more often as guests so that a wife or husband’s potential spouse can adapt his or her bioecological status of the workplace from exosystem to mesosystem. Bronfenbrenner’s socioecological theory proposes that the influence of the self all the way to societal expectations can be divided into four different divisions. (01) In essence, I am proposing that the spouse be introduced into the workplace so that the sphere of influence for the spouse goes from distant to great, which could potentially discourage any workplace related infidelity. How this can work is up in the air obviously, and companies may not be initially be willing to involve themselves in this social experiment, but you can learn to take initiative yourselves. If you have someone you love, maybe stop by to bring by lunch or to have lunch with him or her when he or she is off. That way you can be introduced into the workplace and so that potentially and hopefully, you can have some further influence in your spouse’s indiscretions.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, I suggest that high school students be enrolled into a mandatory debt management class. I would even further suggest that students be allowed to enter into a pretend credit score universe and so that students be allowed to “spend” money on the card and to learn to pay it off in increments utilizing understanding of APR rates. It is obvious that money plays a gigantic role in committed relationships and because of the likelihood that most people will bring into a relationship already an assumed debt, it may be imperative for young people to learn to manage debt and to pay it off as quickly as possible in the possible chance that their future spouses carry debt into the relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I propose that you young people engage in capitalism. Here is a business idea. There are a multitude of tests and studies designed to gauge compatibility between two potential spouses. You can start a business that guarantees that the people you match together to have compatibility – ‘till death. According to Howe and other further studies, it would appear to be that an interview with the two and to match them together would be accomplished potentially with a high degree of probability of success. If you could offer your potential customers a guarantee of a lifetime – then you may find yourself to be very wealthy in the future. This is not a new business idea. There are many companies that exist like described above and has proven especially successful in Asian countries, where it may not be socially appropriate to approach strangers in order to get to know them. It is the author’s intuition that loneliness and a desire to meet life long partners will grow. The market will exist for such a demand, and you may find that you will ride a tidal wave of clientele. The mere fact that your company exists and tests clients in order to match for compatibility will raise awareness of the need for people to clarify what exactly they would like in a relationship, which could change societal standards, should you end up successful in your business ventures.&lt;br /&gt;
Family Relationships&lt;br /&gt;
Three Components of Developing Parenting Identities and Roles&lt;br /&gt;
One component that affects parenting styles is socioeconomic status. According to Howe, parents from lower socioeconomic status parenting styles reflect the job environment in which they spend most of their time in, (01) usually involving “repetitive unskilled labor with few opportunities for independent thinking.” (01) Because of this work environment, parents from lower socioeconomic status may have taught their children to do the same to prepare them for the same future. (01) In contrast to middle and upper-middle class parents, who have flexibility in work schedules and the ability to take time off, tend to raise their children to encourage them to ask questions, think critically, and to engage in conversations. (01) For example, Howe explains a study by Lareau (2002) that lower socioeconomic parents tended to give children more free time to explore and play but expected more obedience from their children, where as middle and upper-middle class children were cultivated an “emerging sense of entitlement” (01), which is to say that the children expected fair treatment and respect. (01) This means that your parents raised you according to the social and economic upbringing they may have had. You may have thought that your parents were just not as nice as other parents, but this theory helps to explain that actually parenting styles may be greatly influenced by your socio-economic background.&lt;br /&gt;
The second component of parenting styles has to do with Diana Baumrind’s 1967 parenting styles study. In essence, Diana Baumrind’s study has to do with three parenting styles that were discovered over hundreds of families over two decades. (01) These three styles were discovered to be authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive/indulgent. Authoritative parenting styles is known as “a parenting style that is high on warmth/responsiveness and also high on control/demandingness; the style related to the best outcomes in western cultures.” (01) Obviously authoritarian styles are low on the warmth/responsiveness and high on the controlling and demanding, while indulgent and permissive is low on both scales. According to Howe, children from authoritarian parents are “more likely to be conformists with few goals for themselves.” (01) In essence, these parenting styles produce different outcomes in children.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, race and ethnicity also appear to another component to parenting styles. Although studies have shown that there appears to be bigger differences in class than ethnicity, there appear to be differences here and there. For example, African American children from both the poor and middle and upper-middle classes tended to engage in religious activity on a higher level than their European counterparts. (01)&lt;br /&gt;
Three Problems Commonly Faced by Families&lt;br /&gt;
One such problem is the changing world economy. From 2000 to 2007 the average American family lost around $2,000 in annual income. (01) More people are coming into relationships and starting families with debt already assumed. And because of economic forces like the internet, companies must now remain competitive in many ways, partially by cutting costs, which may make it more difficult for fathers and mothers to find and maintain jobs. Because of these factors and changes in economy, families must attempt to predict market changes and possibly enter into new industries with hope that they will bloom into fruitful careers. An example of this would be cyber security. According to Howe, income is not the only issue that families face. Healthcare rises at a 20% increase per year. (01) And because of the various related medical treatment a growing family may need to receive, the potential costs for starting a family is great.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, if both families are working then child care immediately becomes another obstacle for families to overcome. Studies have shown that American infants that spend more than 30 hours a week in child care can affect the cognitive functioning of the child. (01) Strangely enough, this same phenomenon repeated for Swedish children was found that the children’s cognitive ability actually improved when placed in the child care program. (01) According to Howe, parents in Sweden are guaranteed paid leave and the opportunity to work a part time job elsewhere. (01) Howe suggests that the same is needed in the United States, that a form of a universal health care and the ability for parents to be able to work less to instead care for the child.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, many families may have to encounter performing multiple roles within the family structure. Although, the studies show that having such multiple roles allows for having less stress levels over all (01), too much of the multiple roles can lead to degradation of mental and physical health. Usually disadvantaged people struggle with this, for example, a minority that is from a poor socioeconomic background that is attempting to make ends meet with multiple jobs and family responsibilities.&lt;br /&gt;
Analyze how Society and Societal Structures Create or Contribute to the Problems&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned earlier, economic forces are causes massive changes to the individual and his or her family. You all are in high school now but soon you will enter the job market. Some of the jobs you will apply for then will not exist now. Furthermore, with the increase of college degrees and rising student costs, there now becomes a risk that a college degree will have little pay out. Finally, when you start your family you may be asked to hold multiple responsibilities from a variety of your peers. In fact, this may be expected or demanded due to the shrinking job market and increased pool of eligible candidates that are entering the workforce. Furthermore, rising middle class populations from emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China will add further strain on the average American to compete with these people. Finally, automation and artificial intelligence will do the majority of the menial tasks that require the employment of many Americans now, so there will be additional strain on Americans to find jobs that will not become extinct in the coming years.&lt;br /&gt;
Describe and Analyze Three Societal-Social Supports&lt;br /&gt;
First, we can follow Howe’s prescription for a form of universal child care system so that parents are able to afford the cost of high-quality service at the expense of tax-payer dollars. Obviously, it costs money for parents to be able to afford these services so it will cost money regardless, either through the willful act of dropping the check off to the day care service or through taxation. Furthermore, we can subsidize the amount of money it could cost to guarantee paid leave for parents onto the taxpayers.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, schools must prepare students for an economy that will be uncertain and unknown for the future. Students need to be equipped to accept jobs that do not yet exist today. Such a project would involve having students learning to solve problems and to resolve them without supervision. A separate class should be mandatory for students to enroll in, a class that teaches students to familiarize themselves with programs that are industry standard now with high performers, like learning to program with Excel, set calendar appointments through Outlook, and to type as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I recommend a time management class to be taken by families. This time management class will teach families how to effectively manage the myriad of roles and responsibilities a family member may be subject to as effectively as possible. This means being able to process information and to recognize its meaning to themselves and to categorize it. This time management class will have the goal to reduce the overall stress and mental and physical deterioration that occurs when family members are too overburdened with responsibilities and roles without the effective use of tools to manage them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology I&lt;br /&gt;
Andy is the owner of the many toys that appear to “live” in Andy’s room. Many of them appear to enjoy their roles as toys. And there is obviously a sense or understanding of inevitable favoritism by Andy. For Andy, Woody was Andy’s favorite toy for some time. Generally, there is not much in the room of anxiety or conflict until Andy’s birthday party arrives, in which the toys greatly fear that they will be replaced by a new toy. Woody tries to calm the toys but the toys still relent with anxiety. Mr. Potato Head goes so far as to say “Of course Woody ain’t worried! He’s been Andy’s favorite since kindergarten!” It also appears to be that the toys view Woody as the toy that leads and directs, mostly exhibited by the ability of Woody to gain the compliance of the toy soldiers. The toys in their anxiety send out the soldier toys in order to spy on the events that transpire during the party that they might be able to see what arrives in the presents that the party attendees gift to Andy. The gifts received are irrelevant to the toys in that the gifts are toys that do not seem to exhibit any ability to be autonomous, i.e., a lunch box and a Battle Ships board game. Finally, when all looks clear for the toys, Andy’s mother pulls out a surprise gift, which is a new toy.&lt;br /&gt;
The toys that collectively call themselves “Andy’s toys” are what social psychology calls a group. A group is “an aggregate of individuals who interact with and influence one another.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, Bordens and Horowitz use the example of a bus stop and the number of people that wait at that bus stop. These people are not a group because they are not “truly influencing each other” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) and they only interact with each other “on a basic level”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Andy’s toys appear to spend a great deal of time together. In fact, these toys individually refer to themselves as Andy’s toys. These toys appear to play together when Andy is not around – Woody is asked to play checkers by Slinky and Buzz Lightyear brushes the hair of the pink troll. The amount of influence they have on each other is conveyed with Woody announces to the other toys that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to today. The toys collectively influence each other in that they all begin an outbreak of anxiety and fear that they will be replaced by a newer toy. Social psychology refers to two types of groups. One is an instrumental group and another is an affiliate group. I propose that both groups have relevancy in Toy Story concerning Andy’s toys. An instrumental group is referred to as groups that exist to “perform some task or reach some specific goal.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) With the exception of Buzz Lightyear, the toys have an understanding that they are indeed toys and that they serve Andy as his toys. An affiliate group is known as a group that exists on a more general level and often for social means. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Though the toys had no choice in the matter of becoming Andy’s toy, they take joy in this and also socialize with each other whenever Andy is not at home.&lt;br /&gt;
There are also group norms associated with Andy’s toys. Group norms are defined as “expectations concerning the kinds of behaviors required of group members”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) On one level they appear to exhibit a basic understanding of morality. Death is not explicitly implied in this movie, however the toys become upset when they assume Woody to be responsible for Buzz falling out of the window. There is another scene where Woody is trying to convince the toys that they ought to assist Woody and Buzz with escaping Sid’s house – Woody uses Buzz’s arm to appear to convey that Buzz is fine. When the toys see through the illusion, Rex the dinosaur appears to gag at the thought of Woody carrying around Buzz’s arm. Furthermore, before the appearance of Buzz Lightyear, it was generally assumed that Woody was Andy’s favorite toy. It appears to be that because Woody is Andy’s favorite toy that he takes a commanding role over the other toys. Furthermore, the toys seem to have their own spot in Andy’s room – Woody’s spot was on Andy’s bed. There also appears to be interdependency between the toys. That is, they need each other. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toy soldiers work together in conjunction with the other toys to spy on the birthday party. Each of the toys seek out moving partner in order to prevent being lost in the moving process. These points clearly indicate in a social psychological perspective that Andy’s toys are collectively a group. This group has social norms, instrumental and affiliative purposes as well as an interdependence of each of the toys to rely on each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology II&lt;br /&gt;
The competition with Buzz Lightyear and Woody begins almost immediately. First, Buzz Lightyear is placed on the bed and left there. This place on the bed is known by the toys and Woody to be “Woody’s spot”. Buzz at this point does not know he is a toy but indeed a real Space Ranger. The toys are ecstatic to see Buzz Lightyear and are impressed with the detail in which Buzz Lightyear was created. They are impressed with Buzz Lightyear’s speaker box going so far as to compare it with Woody’s pull-string speaker box, mentioning that Buzz’s technology is far more advance. Because of that feature along with the overall excitement of a new toy, Buzz gets the attention from the toys instead of the usual by Woody. The scene continues as Andy’s room changes and more of the setting of Andy’s room is filled with Buzz Lightyear themes. Woody walks around to see that Buzz is adding value to the other toys – he brushes the hair of the pink haired troll, he helps Rex to gain a dinosaur’s voice, and even the Etch-a-Sketch walks around with Buzz’s portrait. It even appears to be that Buzz has organized a fitness program for the toys. The last scene shows that Andy has made the choice to leave Woody in the toy bin and instead chooses to opt to sleep with Buzz Lightyear instead.&lt;br /&gt;
Woody displays a need for affiliation in Andy. Not only does Woody experience this need for affiliation, but all of the toys in Andy’s room express that need. Social psychology defines need for affiliation as “a motivation that underlies our desire to establish and maintain rewarding interpersonal relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Although Andy himself is not aware of the toys ability to express human emotions like a living creature, the toys very much feel purpose and belonging in being Andy’s toy. The audience is able to see how distraught Woody becomes when Andy’s room slowly changes into a space-based Buzz Lightyear theme. Woody is seen depressingly residing in the toy chest as he attempts to accept the fact that Buzz Lightyear has become Andy’s new favorite toy. Not only does Woody display a need for affiliation, he also expressed a need for intimacy. Bordens and Horowitz describe this need as “a motivation for close and affectionate relationships.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) The toys express wonder and awe that Buzz’s new features and his ability to solve basic problems that the toys have. For example, Buzz Lightyear shows Rex how to find his “scary” voice. Woody appears to be ignored as the toys fawn over the new toy that is Buzz Lightyear. Both the struggle for the need for intimacy as well as affiliation obviously leads to a very visibly distraught Woody, who spends the night along in the toy chest as Andy falls asleep with Buzz Lightyear in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;
This sense of frustration at the change of Andy’s affection toward Woody and growth of affection toward Buzz Lightyear as well as Buzz Lightyear seemingly being incapable of understanding that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear can be visibly seen throughout the scenes as Andy plays with Buzz and neglecting Woody. This frustration likely led Woody to confront Buzz Lightyear and to attempt to stop Buzz Lightyear from being taken to Pizza Planet. Social psychology refers to a link between frustration and aggression. This is called the frustration-aggression hypothesis. This hypothesis views that aggression is “always the consequence of frustration . . . the occurrence of aggressive behavior presupposes the existence of frustration and, contrariwise . . . the existence of frustration leads to some form of aggression.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) This hypothesis holds three parts. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) First is the strength of the original drive. Woody was used to being Andy’s favorite toy and is shocked at change and inability to influence the direction that Andy is going with his favoritism growing toward Buzz Lightyear. Second is the degree to which the behavior is thwarted. Buzz Lightyear is not actively attempting to become Andy’s favorite toy, since Buzz Lightyear himself does not even believe that he is a toy. This could potentially be more frustrating for Woody than if Buzz Lightyear was actively confronting Woody in an attempt to become Andy’s favorite toy. Finally, the number of frustrated responses. The movie scene with Andy continuously playing with Buzz Lightyear instead of Woody portrays the numerous amounts of times that Woody becomes dismayed at the growing evident truth that Andy no longer considers Woody to be his favorite toy. Therefore, it is very possible to see the connection between the frustration and anger that builds up inside of Woody as a result of the appearance of Buzz Lightyear.&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes That Accurately Represent Social Psychology III&lt;br /&gt;
A quarrel between Andy and Woody results in being taken to Sid’s house. We witness Sid’s manipulation of the toys in what appears to be a sick and twisted way. The movie portrays Sid as the antagonist in which the toys fearfully avoid any contact with Sid. While captured in Sid’s room, Woody and Buzz encounter the strange creatures that Sid has manipulated and disfigured. They witness what appears to be the toys fighting over the remains of a toy that Sid had just disfigured. Buzz mentions that they are cannibals and they hide for refuge. After a session of being tortured by Sid, Woody and Buzz notice that the door to Sid’s room is open. As they attempt to make a run for it to escape, they are again approached by the disfigured toys in Sid’s room. And before the toys can manage anything, Woody activates Buzz’s karate chop action to keep the disfigured toys at bay as they escape from the room. While Woody attempts to establish an escape route to Andy’s house, Buzz is swarmed by the so-called cannibal toys. Woody fights his way to the circle and when he reaches the inside of the circle he finds that instead of the toys have repaired Buzz. They are, instead of cannibals, humanistic toys. Not only are they not cannibals, but they are also very shy. We see that the toys, though horribly disfigured, are able to convey empathy because they agree to help Woody save Buzz. Their cooperation is finally seen in full action when the toys act against Sid and coordinate confronting Sid and his abuse of his toys.&lt;br /&gt;
Woody and Buzz made a judgement about Sid’s toys based on what they saw and felt. This process is called impression formation. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Specifically, there are two types of this impression formation according to social psychology. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) The first is automatic processing and the second is controlled processing. Automatic processing is known as the idea that we process information without much thought. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) This idea runs parallel or in conjunction to the idea of humans being cognitive misers. A cognitive miser is known as “a label suggesting that because humans have a limited capacity to understand information, we only deal with small amounts of social information and prefer the least effortful means of processing it.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Another important understanding to the automatic and controlled processing theory is that both are not separate entities but rather a continuum from ranging from more or less of two sides. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Considering the situation that Woody and Buzz were in – that is, in complete terror of Sid’s house and being in the close proximity of Sid, it is very evident that Woody and Buzz made a judgment of social processing of the disfigured toys owned by Sid. The toys were disfigured and monstrous looking and the first encounter Woody and Buzz has with these creatures is when they witness the appearance of the creatures attempting to fight over the remains of another disfigured toy. Of course, as the movie continues we see that the creatures are not actually cannibals at all and the controlled processing of social judgement is evident in Woody when he attempts to fight off the creatures who appear to be attempting to eat Buzz. Woody sees that Buzz has actually in fact been repaired. The realization that his social processing judgement was not correct is evident in that it takes him a few moments to realize how wrong Woody and Buzz were about the creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology I&lt;br /&gt;
Buzz Lightyear is introduced to the audience as the toy that believes he is real, as in he believes the character he was designed to be. Part of the tension that arises from Buzz and Woody results in the error in Buzz’s perception, believing he is truly a real Space Ranger. In the first encounter with Woody and resulting altercation, Buzz jumps off the bed and manages to land an aerial maneuver which the audience knows to be as Woody says, “falling in style”. This error is corrected when, while in the depths of Sid’s house, Buzz sees a television commercial advertising the toy. Buzz walks away from the television in shock. He then sees a window and jumps off the top of the stairs in order to prove to himself that he is the real Buzz Lightyear and that he can indeed fly. He falls to the bottom of the stairs and the camera pans out as we see a broken Buzz Lightyear as his arm has fallen off. We next see Buzz a participant of a tea party, becoming a character known as Ms. Nesbitt. It is obvious to the audience he is delirious or has become drunk from the tea party. He spends a certain amount of time in melancholy as he processes that he is merely a toy. In the final capture scene with Woody and Buzz, Woody manages to convey to Buzz the value inherent in being “Andy’s toy”. Buzz gains understanding of his place in the world and they eventually escape and manage being returned to Andy.&lt;br /&gt;
Autobiographical memory is known as “memory for information relating to the self that plays a powerful role in recall of events.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Buzz Lightyear has a perception of himself based on memories that do not exist. That is, he believes himself to be the real Buzz Lightyear when he is in fact, a toy. Furthermore, Buzz Lightyear is also a character from a fictional story. So, Buzz Lightyear as we know it in the movie is a toy that believes himself to be a character that is actually a fictional. According to social psychology, Buzz Lightyear takes from his memories in order to form a larger identity of self-perception. This theory is plausible in the circumstance of real human beings but cannot be applied readily to toys with anthropomorphic features. Being that Buzz Lightyear is a toy it cannot be readily explained by social psychology how the personality of Buzz Lightyear was created and why he believes himself to be the Buzz Lightyear, which again is in fact a fictional character. How was he able to emulate the events and personality of the character if we assume that Buzz Lightyear was in his original packaging until he was opened?&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology II&lt;br /&gt;
A significant hurdle to understanding Toy Story is the dynamic between Andy and the toys that belong to Andy. To the toys Andy plays a significant role and the identity of the toys all revolve around Andy. The significance of the relationship between Andy and the toys can be seen in the mark that Andy leaves on the bottom of Woody and Buzz’s boot. This signifies to the toys that they belong to Andy. There is a great deal of emphasis in Andy shown in the anxiety at the consequent birthday parties in which potential new toys arrive. Andy, though unaware, has significant power over the toys in that he could discard a toy or neglect it and that toy would understand the repercussions of Andy’s actions. This is why the toys display anxiety when Andy’s birthday party comes – they fear being discarded or replaced. Sid is also another figure that conveys large amounts of power over the toys. An important point to mention is that the toys resume a lifeless state when in the presence of a human, with the exception of the confrontation of Sid by the toys that Sid has disfigured, in which the toys are at the mercy of the user.&lt;br /&gt;
Ostracism is known as “the widespread and universal behavior of excluding or ignoring other individuals or groups”. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) Bordens and Horowitz explain two types of ostracism: punitive and defensive. Punitive ostracism is used to punish or to deter unwanted behavior and defensive ostracism is used to protect oneself or group from others. (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) However, social psychology does not explain the ostracism that occurs when for example, in Toy Story, a toy is replaced by a newer, better toy. There is simply no sort of human behavior that can be explained in this view of social psychology. Andy holds in some ways a sort of God like power over the toys, though he is completely unaware of that power. And in what way is a human being ever replaced by a newer human being and then simply discarded?&lt;br /&gt;
It is the authors belief, though not explicitly stated, that ostracism exists because humans cannot simply be replaced with a newer more functioning form of the same human being. The individual is instead merely ostracized. Though religion may be able to explain a phenomenon similar to the anxiety the toys feel at being replaced, there simply is no phenomena that occurs in the way that Andy is portrayed as. There can be no doubt that Andy, though he has no idea that his toys can talk, has an incredible amount of influence over the toys. Andy also interacts with them, though when he interacts with the toys it is a lifeless toy he interacts with. However, it appears that they remember and are aware of the events that take place as the humans play with them. In essence, the toys represent a sort of one-sided relationship. Andy does not communicate with them nor does he understand that the toys have feelings for him. It is therefore ostracism that comes closest to the type of dynamic that occurs between the toys when they fear being replaced as a result of Andy’s birthday gifts, but it does not come close to actual human behavior because we are not toys and toys are not capable of thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes That Inaccurately Represent Social Psychology III&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, there is the question of Sid. We are introduced to the character very nearly in the beginning, nearly at around the same time that Buzz Lightyear is introduced. We see Sid’s apparent lack of empathy towards the toys, and since the audience views the toys as creatures capable of understanding of complex thoughts as well as pain, we view Sid’s approach to play as torture. Because we view Sid’s actions as torture the audience is able to see Sid’s image as that of a sociopath. Despite the movie’s portrayal of Sid as a sociopath, he displays interesting features that are unlike that of a sociopath. In the final confrontation of Sid by the disfigured toys we see that Sid is capable of experiencing fear. Would Sid have continued to “torture” the toys if he had known they were capable of sentient thought?&lt;br /&gt;
Socio-interactional model states that “antisocial behavior arises early in life and is the result of poor parenting, leading a child to develop conduct problems that affect peer relations and academic performance.” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014) When the audience is given a peek into the life of Sid and can take an objective look at the situation in his house, things look fairly decent. That is, Sid’s mother doesn’t appear to be abusive or neglectful and Sid still appears to have a father in the household, albeit a potentially lazy father. Furthermore, apart from bothering his sister, Sid appears to be a normal boy. The audience has the omniscient effect in that they are able to see that the toys can talk and indeed feel pain when they are tortured. However, Sid is unaware of this until the of the movie when Sid’s toys confront him. Despite the many theories of aggression, including the social-modeling theory of aggression by Albert Bandura, which theorizes that “attitude formation learning through watching what people do and whether they are rewarded or punished and then imitating that behavior” (Bordens, Bordens, &amp;amp; Horowitz, 2014), Sid appears to be a healthy boy despite the view of the audience that Sid tortures toys. As Sid is torturing Woody with a magnifying glass, he quotes what appears to be a Star Wars quote saying “Where are your rebel friends now?” as he roleplays the role of the interrogator. Does social-psychology account for the boy’s desire to roleplay and explore different roles, even aggressive roles? Social-psychology does account for evolutionary reasons for aggression, but appears to be, to the opinion of the author, incapable of explaining the necessity for people to act out aggressive behaviors in positive ways, let alone boys who are experiencing increases of testosterone.&lt;br /&gt;
Plausibility&lt;br /&gt;
There is very little in the way of plausibility of Toy Story at first glance. As far as we know it, toys do not speak nor do they move on their own. However, from a social psychology perspective these toys exhibit many different facets of social psychology. First, the relationship between the toys as they relate to each other, empathize, and even unknowingly engaging in groupthink lends to the plausibility of social psychological concepts. The toys move against Woody when they assume that Woody was attempting to murder Buzz Lightyear despite having a clear lack of evidence against Woody. The toys also engage and interact with each other as a group – they very clearly show the ability to influence each other like for example, when the toys collectively panic when they see that Andy’s birthday party had been moved to the current day. They also show deeper levels of interaction – Woody and Bo Peep express romantic gestures and Woody and Slinky also express a deep sort of relationship. Woody and Buzz even express aggression and competition with each other. However, the author makes note of the insulation of the world in which the toys live in. The humans appear to be oblivious to the lives of the toys and rightly so, as generally it can be assumed that toys do not move and talk autonomously. So, from within the group and perspectives of the toys it can be said that the social psychological plausibility is very high. But once the examination of this plausibility extends further, more outward from the group it can be said that the plausibility is very low. That is, the toys only interact with themselves and of course with the humans, but the humans do not knowingly interact with the toys. In this context are the toys the Gods or fairies which manipulate the lives of humans or do humans play the role of God with the ability to destroy or create the toys and their personalities? Social psychology does not explain this, understandably.&lt;br /&gt;
Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;
Toy Story is arguably a story created for children. There is of course, subtle adult humor as in for example, Mr. Potato Head taking his mouth and bumping it against his backside as Slinky attempts to calm the toys in defense of Woody when it is discovered that the birthday party is today. But the story is for children. An important concept of raising children is to teach children empathy. And Toy Story utilizes the concept of using what is commonly seen as an inanimate object to portray those lessons of empathy. There are multiple reasons for this, the author believes. First is the ability to capture the attention of the toys. Children can relate to toys because they interact with toys in imaginative play. The viewing of the toys talking and interacting with each other gives children audience members an opportunity to imagine and to partake in creative play as they watch the movie. Second, being able to take the toys perspective also encourages children to take a look at another’s perspective, or to put one’s self in another’s shoes. This is another exercise in empathy. Third, the movie is able to explore some darker elements of human behavior like for example, aggression, through the use of toys so that the lesson is learned or taught without being explicit with details. In the movie death is only implied but never explicitly said; an example of this being the Bazooka Joe toy that is strapped to the rocket by Sid and is blown up. Another example being Buzz Lightyear falling out of the window as Woody attempted to hide him from Andy. In essence, low level concepts of social psychology can be taught to children with the use of toys bearing anthropomorphic features that exhibit autonomous traits like walking and talking. Of course, the plausibility of the movie from a reality standpoint as well as a psychological standpoint only goes so far as the group elements of the toys, but that cannot be helped since these elements are only explained in simplistic ideas in order to help children grasp larger elements of the need to express empathy in humanity. So, in that view Toy Story is a giant success.&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>PSY411 Abnormal Psychology Final Project (Hypothetical observation of 12-year-old, anxiety, and CBT)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy411-abnormal-psychology-final-project/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy411-abnormal-psychology-final-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;
For the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, the following symptoms of the 12-year-old patient were noticed. First, she displays fidgeting, chews her hair, and does not like to be in new situations. Possibly the dislike of being in new situations brings about the fidgeting and the chewing of the hair. But the case study does not clarify. She appears to have a difficult time staying seated in class. She says that it is not comfortable, though the case study does not clarify if she meant that the chair was uncomfortable in the potential context of an anxiety disorder. Her condition relating to sitting in the chair apparently gets worse on test days with the claim that she is not feeling well. Her report that she has no friends could be a result of having a form of social anxiety. Her family history displays anxiety disorders on the mother’s side of the family, with both the mother and grandmother coping with panic attacks. The patient’s father is in the Navy and is gone for long periods. The patient appears to demonstrate some form of separation anxiety when her father leaves.&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
First, I would make use of a clinical interview. If the child has a form of anxiety then what would be needed initially would be to make use of a clinical interview to make observations but also to build rapport with the child. (Kring et al., 2018) He or she may not be able to trust the therapist enough to give the therapist responsive answers. The pro to this method would be that the interviewer would get a clearer understanding of what the 12-year-old patient thinks and feels instead of the initial observations made by the case study. A con of this method would be that a therapist must be careful not to ask leading questions and often times this method takes time because of the needed rapport building before the patient feels comfortable to answer honestly with the therapist. (Kring et al., 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Second, I would conduct an official structured assessment with the use of the “Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders” or SCARED. This assessment allows for both the child and the parent to fill out a questionnaire. The final score is added together to provide further insight whether or not the child may have a form of clinical anxiety. A total score of 25 or more will indicate that the child may have a form of anxiety. The benefit to this assessment is that the scores are broken down into various forms of anxiety, which would help the therapist target specifically which form of anxiety to provide for therapy. For example, a score of 5 for items or questions 4, 8, 13, 16, 20, 25, 29, 31 would indicate that the patient may have a form of separation anxiety disorder which would explain some of the behavior that the patient exhibits like for example, when her father goes away on military deployment. A con to this method would be that the child may not fully understand the depth of the questions being asked. Even with the help of a parent or a teacher, the child may have trouble with the interpretation of the question. Second, a parent filling out the card may be limited in the perception of the child because in our example of the 12-year-old patient, the father may not be around the child often enough to be able to assess the child, even with the structured questions.&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;br /&gt;
First the matter of family history – the patient’s family has a history of anxiety on the mother’s side. Both the mother and the grandmother display signs of anxiety and still cope with panic attacks. Twin studies and family association studies have demonstrated a link with genetic material and the environment. (Manassis, 2002) The link between the patient’s family history, the environment that she lives in as well as studies that indicate the relationship between the two likely make to build for a strong case of anxiety in the patient. Furthermore, the patient demonstrates numerous health issues. She has migraines, severe food allergies, a history of seizures, and developmental milestone delays. The patient also has a heart condition in which her heartrate beats more rapidly than normal. Such a condition can lead to an infant experiencing irritability, sweating, rapid breathing, poor feeding and poor weight gain. (Cardiology Associates of Houston, 2018) It is not a stretch of imagination to assume that the patient is generally uncomfortable due to the many health issues she experiences. Anxiety is linked with a higher rate of cardiovascular disease along with other medical conditions. (Kring et al., 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
D&lt;br /&gt;
The common trait of therapy for anxiety related disorders is exposure. (Kring et al., 2018) This form of therapy seeks to reduce the triggers that elicit the anxiety or fear. Usually, therapists and the patient get together to form a list of fears and will start by ranking those fears from least to greatest. This is called an “exposure hierarchy”. In this exposure hierarchy, patients learn to deal with the triggers – usually starting with the ones that elicit the smallest amount of anxiety and fear – and are gradually moved up the exposure hierarchy as patients learn to overcome the anxiety. This form of therapy is effective for 70-90% of patients. (Kring et al., 2018) The amount of time I would recommend for our patient would be a six-month period in which she learns to handle her anxiety through the use of cognitive behavioral therapy by exposure of triggers. There is a statistical significance to the six-month period. The six-month period is the minimal amount of time required for the effects of the therapy to endure. (Kring et al., 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
If after six months the symptoms do not appear to lessen then a secondary option can be considered for the patient. The patient, with the parent’s approval, can be a D-cycloserine treatment. D-cycloserine, or DCS, enhances the learning process. (Kring et al., 2018) Studies have shown that DCS had diminished the amount of fear that a patient experienced with regards to acrophobia in a test that involved one group taking DCS and another taking a placebo. This drug is taken in conjunction with CBT and so far, the drug appears to enhance CBT. (Kring et al., 2018) The downside to this drug is that it is fairly new so there are only selective offerings of DCS available to patients.&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;br /&gt;
Anxiety may be the most common form of psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) Women, more than men, are also much more likely to fall into this category. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) The screening process for our 12-year-old patient is recommended through the use of rating the severity of anxious symptoms. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore, according to this recommendation we have selected the SCARED structured assessment in order to develop the diagnosis that the patient has a form of anxiety disorder. The SCARED assessment allows for both the parent and child to evaluate the anxious symptoms which would be a benefit to the therapists and those seeking to diagnose the patient because the patient may have some difficulty in the interpretation of the questions. Parent answered questions about the patient may provide for more clarity and consistency. This screening process must carefully assess whether the symptoms experienced by the patient are related to anxiety or if there are comorbid symptoms relating to a medical condition. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) There is a benefit to the SCARED test in that it is available for free online. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015)&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple studies that point toward hereditary relationships between anxiety disorders and genetics. (Manassis, 2002) Twin studies, family association studies, temperamental risk-factors all point toward heredity in anxiety. The patient has both mother and grandmother that experience anxiety through panic attacks. All three generations of these women appear to express a continuity in expression of anxiety. Behavior inhibition is a matter of temperament. (Manassis, 2002) What would be useful to the clinician would be if the mother of the 12-year-old patient displayed symptoms of behavior inhibition and if our 12-year-old patient also expressed behavior inhibition when she was younger.&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, there needs to be further evaluation what sort of developmental milestone delays occurred in our patient’s life. Behavior inhibition may have occurred as a result of our patient being unable to develop at a normal rate. Furthermore, parenting styles are also to be brought into question. Likely the stress of the patient having medical abnormalities as well as many other limitations such as allergies and developmental delays could have caused the parents to seek to shelter the patient from new outcomes. Parents assist children in overcoming behavioral inhibition through the use of encouraging and guiding the child. (Manassis, 2002) However, the mother of our patient has anxiety also – there could be once source of anxiety for our patient.&lt;br /&gt;
That being said CBT has benefits for young children and caretaker alike. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) Specifically, the “psychoeducation of child and caregivers regarding the nature of anxiety; techniques for managing somatic reactions including relaxation training and diaphragmatic breathing; cognitive restructuring by identifying and challenging anxiety-provoking thoughts” and so on. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) In studies relating to the effectiveness of CBT, CBT was found more effective by a margin of 24% compared to placebo groups, whereas CBT in conjunction with medication was found to be 81% more effective compared to CBT alone (60%), or simply the medication (55%). (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) However, the same study has shown that the relapse rate for acute sufferers tend to be nearly half of the participants. It is clear that CBT and CBT in conjunction with medication is not the only solution to this long-term disorder. Our patient is statistically at a disadvantage when it comes to predictors of success. According to one study, those with first-degree relatives had “poorer functional outcomes”. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) Therefore it may be necessary to provide for the patient CBT that includes holistically, both parents or simply the mother as a secondary patient. There may be some form of a feedback loop between the patient and the mother and it is likely that both need a form of psychoeducation to further equip the parents and the patient with abilities to cope with the anxiety. I have not recommended the use of psychiatric drugs because of the low level of success with long term results. (Wehry, Beesdo-Baum, Hennelly, Connolly, &amp;amp; Strawn, 2015) It is the many variables of anxiety that can potentially confound therapists in the diagnosis of the disorder, it being necessary to carefully select which symptoms relate to anxiety itself or are a result of comorbidity. Our 12-year-old patient suffers from multiple health problems, severe food allergies being one issue. Specifically, food allergies have been linked to anxiety. (Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, 2018) Our patient reports having no friends in school. She may be struggling with dealing with her medical issues while at the same time attempting to get along with her peers. Food allergies, which are potentially life or death situations, can be very stressful to a girl that would like to sit down and have a meal with her peers. Furthermore, though the relationship between food allergies and anxiety is not entirely clear, though being very clearly linked together, it could be hypothesized that the food allergies brings some sort of embarrassment to the person.&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize – our patient suffers from anxiety. Her mother and her grandmother also have anxiety and still to this day experience panic attacks. It is clear that the anxiety the mother and grandmother have is not diagnosed. CBT with the mother’s involvement would greatly benefit both the patient and the mother. The patient also suffers from medical conditions and developmental milestone delays. Therefore, on top of the anxiety that the patient experiences, potentially, would be the comorbidity of other symptoms relating to her medical illness. It is therefore very important to make a proper assessment of the anxiety and to attempt to interpret symptoms in the light that she may not have anxiety but rather anxiety like symptoms relating to her medical condition. That is why I have suggested the use of the SCARED assessment with both her and her parents to take the assessment. This would further reduce the chance of misdiagnosis by the therapist since both the parents and the child will answer to the assessment separately. An informal clinical interview also ought to be set up before a formal structured assessment in order to build rapport with the patient. (Kring et al., 2018) Once rapport has been built and with parental approval, CBT can begin. As mentioned earlier, a minimum treatment plan of at least 6 months is recommended. This is statistically significant that the patient completes at least 6 months of therapy as that is the amount of time on average required to see an effect from the therapy. If after six months therapy does not appear to show significant effect, then CBT with the use of D-cycloserine is recommended. This is a drug that aids in the learning process and is not a benzodiazepine, as studies have shown the ineffectiveness of benzodiazepine in treatment of young children and juveniles. It is for that purpose I have not recommended medication. Finally, my recommendation is for the family to begin CBT together as a family, or as much as possibly allowed considering the father’s work schedule. The father may not be around often enough to experience the full effect of his spouse’s anxiety and panic attacks, but likely he is well aware of them. The domain of anxiety has many triggers and with a family of anxiety sufferers likely the negative feedback loop continues. This must be a family effort to improve the mental health of the daughter, mother, and even grandmother. The patient is statistically not likely to make a recovery due to the family history, environment, and numerous medical conditions. But the first start can be from within the home. And it is this author’s belief that the home is where the therapy should begin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects over 51 million people worldwide. (Getz, 2014) Many of those affected with schizophrenia have auditory hallucinations, paranoia, significant social dysfunction, and cognitive decline. (Getz, 2014) There is no cure for this mental illness. Furthermore, this mental illness seems to be genetic in its causes, with one’s chance of being 1% in the general population compared to 10% if you’ve had a first-degree relative that’s also had schizophrenia. (Psychology Today, 2018) Although its exact causes are unknown, researchers now know that the neurotransmitters, specifically the ones associated with the dopamine and glutamate receptors, are correlated with those that have schizophrenia. (Psychology Today, 2018) Medication through the use of anti-psychotics is a common treatment for those with schizophrenia. Although the treatment of schizophrenia through the use of anti-psychotics does not cure schizophrenia, much of the positive symptoms of the illness, like the reduction of psychotic episodes, can be reduced drastically. However, this is not case with all that have schizophrenia, as some do not experience a reduction in the psychotic episodes. (Psychology Today, 2018) Schizophrenia is a serious disorder and affects many people worldwide. Therefore, it is the central topic for this discussion in order to more fully understand schizophrenia in terms of diagnosis, symptoms, causes, and treatment.&lt;br /&gt;
Part I&lt;br /&gt;
There are two types of symptoms of schizophrenia: positive and negative. The positive symptoms are probably the best well known to the public and includes hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. (Getz, 2014) Although these positive symptoms may appear to be the same in nature, they are in fact very different. Hallucination refers to the distortion or inaccuracy of sensory experiences. (Getz, 2014) This distortion or inaccuracy of the sensory experience is what causes someone experiencing them to believe the hallucinations to be true. Although one could experience these hallucinations in any kind of manner, auditory appears to be the most common distortion. (Getz, 2014) Delusions are “the fixed false beliefs that are resistant to reason or actual fact.” (Getz, 2014) This can be through feelings of grandeur, feelings of being persecuted, and erotomania, or excessive sexual desire. (Getz, 2014) Paranoia is the feeling that someone is out to get oneself. (Getz, 2014) This manifests in strange behavior that results in engaging in behavior to avoid being caught. (Getz, 2014) And although these symptoms seem the strangest of the schizophrenia mental illness, they are usually most easily treated through the use of anti-psychotics. (Getz, 2014) Negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be: “anhedonia, flat effect, thought poverty, and social withdrawal.” (Getz, 2014) Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. The flat effect has to do with the persons having no expression as they speak, or lack of facial movement, and a monotonous voice. (Getz, 2014) Thought poverty has to do with the reduction in the quantity of thoughts with those affected with schizophrenia. Social withdrawal may occur as a result of the mixture the symptoms of the symptoms of schizophrenia that one experiences as well as the inability of those that don’t have schizophrenia to understand in an empathetic manner how it is when one experiences auditory hallucinations or feelings of paranoia.&lt;br /&gt;
Part II&lt;br /&gt;
The brain relies upon the neurons firing correctly in order all four major parts of the brain to function correctly. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) These neurons send electrical messages through neurotransmitters. There are two specific neurotransmitters that are associated with schizophrenia – the glutamate receptor and the dopamine receptor. Dopamine is found in the basal ganglia. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) This is in the lower part of the cerebrum. Specifically, the pathways of dopamine in the brain are, (1) nigrostriatal, (2) mesolimbic, (3) mesocortical, (4) and the tuberohypophyseal. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) The second, glutamate, is found nearly everywhere on the body. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) This receptor deals with the excitation of the nerves. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) Finally, further development in brain scanning technology has led to a few interesting features of schizophrenics relating to the brain. Computerized tomography scans have revealed that there is a widening of the cortical sulci. (Lewis, 2015) Furthermore, schizophrenics tend to have enlarged ventricles in the brain. (Lewis, 2015) Patients with schizophrenia also tended to have approximately 5% less volume of the neocortex and “specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices.” (Lewis, 2015) Continuing, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that there is a decreased volume in the limbic system, especially for the hippocampus.&lt;br /&gt;
Part III&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment the cause of schizophrenia is pointing towards a biological cause. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) It is known that one’s chances of having schizophrenia is much higher when one has a close relative that also had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) Another possible cause of schizophrenia is obstetrics. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) Many studies have shown that many of those with schizophrenia have had mothers with complications from birth. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) A 1957 flu epidemic revealed that mothers infected with the flu during the second month of their pregnancy were double the chance of giving birth to a child with schizophrenia. Another aspect could be marijuana use, which scientists currently are undergoing research to discover the connection more clearly. As far as the issue of nature vs. nurture goes concerning schizophrenia, the exact causes are still yet unknown. Researchers have clues which may lead one to believe that schizophrenia is absolutely biological in its cause but the results are still inconclusive; it is reasonable at this point, given the amount of research and variety involved in the total number of factors relating to schizophrenia that do not provide conclusive evidence, to assume that for now, both the environment and genetic factors are involved.&lt;br /&gt;
Part IV&lt;br /&gt;
There is no single test that can diagnose schizophrenic. (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2018) Furthermore, other diagnoses must be ruled out to ensure that the patient has schizophrenia rather than bi-polar disorder or severe depression, all of which can convey similar symptoms to schizophrenia. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) To specifically be diagnosed with schizophrenia, “there must be at least six months of some negative and/or positive symptoms. In addition, within those six months, there must be at least one month of positive symptoms or negative symptoms for most of a month.” (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) According to the DSM-IV the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are six points; first, two or more characteristic symptoms for the duration of a substantial portion of one month, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms. (Lewis, 2015) Second, social/occupational dysfunction. Third, continuous signs of disturbance persist for at least six months, with one month of the first points of the criteria. (Lewis, 2015) Fourth, schizoaffective and mood disorder exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Fifth, substance and general medical condition exclusion. (Lewis, 2015) Finally, a relationship to a pervasive development disorder. All of these symptoms and criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia are psychiatric. Because there is no known cause for the basis of schizophrenia, there are not yet complete tests created to diagnose schizophrenia, for example, through a blood test or a simple magnetic resonance imagining examination.&lt;br /&gt;
Part V&lt;br /&gt;
Buck is a man that was diagnosed with schizophrenia. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) He feels that he is not able to do as much as he did before he was sick. He still feels some sense of depression from his diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he notes that when he sees his daughter he feels there is hope in the world. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) Joseph was 18 when he discovered he had schizophrenia. (Miller &amp;amp; Mason, 2002) He had symptoms of paranoia in that he thought the FBI was following him. It got worse until he felt he needed to check into a hospital. There he attempted to commit suicide. After speaking with other patients, he begins to feel that he that his own life was not as bad in comparison. After being discharged from the hospital he attempted a year without seeking help. He assumes that there was probably some shame in the fact that he was schizophrenic. Now he attends college, holds a steady relationship, and has daily structure in his life. There are numerous stories of patients and their diagnosis with schizophrenia, but the important aspect that these patients seem to be reaching is a sense of acceptance that they have schizophrenia, which requires an adaptation of life to work around the disorder.&lt;br /&gt;
Treatment&lt;br /&gt;
The first treatment is medication. Specifically, the type of medication used is commonly known as a conventional antipsychotic. (Lewis, 2015) They are all similar in that they are dopamine receptor antagonists. (Lewis, 2015) They are to be taken orally or to be injected. (Lewis, 2015) This medication is predicated off the belief that schizophrenia occurs as a result of hypersensitive dopamine receptors, or “an excess of dopaminergic activity.” (Lewis, 2015) Studies have found that patients with psychotic symptoms have also had an increase of dopamine release during a period of psychosis. (Lewis, 2015) However because of the decrease in overall dopamine production provided by the medication, patients can experience negative side-effects of the medication known as extrapyramidal symptoms. (Getz, 2014) Extrapyramidal symptoms usually involve symptoms such as “tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movement), parkinsonism, akithesia, and dystonia.” (Getz, 2014) These extrapyramidal symptoms occur as a natural side effect of a reduction of dopamine production but specifically a reduction of dopamine receptors or dopamine blockage in the basal ganglia part of the brain. There are many different types of dopamine antagonist medications but recent studies have found that there is very little difference in the overall efficacy of the newer medication over the older medication. (Getz, 2014) Furthermore, newer medication has been shown to have an increased side-effect of weight gain with an increased chance of diabetes as well as being nearly 10 times more in cost. (Getz, 2014) Therefore prescribing of the dopamine antagonist medication must be, according to a $42.6-million study known as the “Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness” that though the medications that reduce dopamine receptors are similar in effectiveness overall, that the individual patient be considered in the prescription of a specific type. (Getz, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
The two benefits to medication are first, the decrease in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. (Lewis, 2015) The second is the relative ease of use concerning medication, which can be taken orally. Two negatives to medication are first, the medication only reduces positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The medication cannot reduce negative symptoms or cognitive disabilities relating to schizophrenia. And second, because the medication is to be taken on a regimen, or a schedule, there is a now a burden of responsibility on the patient and the caregiver to ensure that the patient receives the medication according to schedule. In summary, I would personally recommend the use of medication to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is not only my own opinion but of the opinions supported by general research that medication, as of now, is the only known treatment for the reduction of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In certain cases, medication, particularly dopamine antagonists, have been found to be ineffective for some with schizophrenia. However, the use of such medication is usually attempted and can be successful in the reduction of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia if followed correctly according to the regimen. I would completely recommend this form of intervention.&lt;br /&gt;
Another form of treatment is known as the psychosocial form of treatment, or psychotherapy. Although medication can diminish or greatly lower the frequency of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, patients are still learning to recover from this disorder from the damage that was done socially – the relationships that were strained and perhaps lost from the onset of the symptoms of schizophrenia and from the loss of quality of life. These are problems that medication itself cannot fix. Psychotherapies such as cognitive remediation therapy is a form of psychotherapy that is focused on helping people to “adjust their goals and expectations to match their own abilities and skills.” (Getz, 2014) Continuing, “…Making such adjustments requires an objective understanding of own’s own cognitive strengths and weaknesses.” (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation therapy has shown to be beneficial in the improvement of social and cognitive function. (Getz, 2014) Specifically, cognitive remediation therapy applies the therapy in a clinical setting where positive reinforcements and scaffolding is applied. (Getz, 2014) This method has shown improvement in the cognitive function in just over six months’ time. (Getz, 2014) Another form of psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, like cognitive remediation therapy, has shown through trials that significant improvement in can be made through these methods, with cognitive behavioral therapy showing the same effect of that of clozapine in “four large, independent, randomized controlled trials”. (Lewis, 2015) Cognitive behavioral therapy has two elements which are, like cognitive remediation therapy, performed in a clinical setting. The first element is the cognition element, which involves “identifying links between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, identifying automatic thoughts, hypothesis testing about abnormal beliefs; reframing attributions, and identifying and enhancing coping strategies.” (Lewis, 2015) The behavioral element involves “symptom monitoring; the use of a diary, distraction techniques; focusing strategies for ‘voices’, graded task assignment, and anxiety management and relation techniques.” (Lewis, 2015)&lt;br /&gt;
Psychotherapy does not affect the neurotransmitters specifically. However, MRI studies indicate that brain activity in specific areas relating to schizophrenia have increased as a result of psychotherapy. (Getz, 2014) Cognitive remediation and cognitive behavioral therapy both focus on coping mechanisms and the means to continue on with one’s life after one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The two benefits from psychotherapy is first, psychotherapy provides for a means to continue on with one’s own social life and professional work life through learning to cope with the disorder. Medication greatly reduces the number of symptoms that schizophrenia exhibits but now one must learn to cope with this disorder, which psychotherapy supports. Second, psychotherapy in conjunction with medication can greatly improve the chance of success. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown that it can reduce relapse risk by 50%. (Lewis, 2015) Two negatives to psychotherapy is first the lack of overwhelming evidence of success similar to the documentation available on the effectiveness of dopamine antagonist medications. And because cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive remediation therapy is not standardized, there is a challenge presented in the documentation and standardization of practice, since usually such therapy is individualized to suit the patient’s various needs. Second, as of now, medication is the only one known effective method of treatment. Psychotherapy is only as effective as the patient’s ability to maintain a schedule and to consistently attend therapy sessions. Based on the information presented above, I would also recommend psychotherapy with the specific clause that it only be recommended after the use of medication is prescribed. This author holds the opinion that medication with the use of psychotherapy can provide for some, perhaps most, and one day all, another chance at a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Developmental psychology is a scientific approach which aims to explain growth, change, and consistency through the lifespan. Developmental psychology looks at how thinking, feeling, and behavior change throughout a person’s life.” (Mcleod, 2012) This theory of developmental psychology mostly builds on theories related to a person’s childhood, as “this is the period during an individual’s lifespan when the most change occurs.” (Mcleod, 2012) The theories developed by researchers like Vygotsky, Piaget, and many others point to the fundamental purpose of the theories of developmental psychology – that is, the relationship of people and environment and that “humans seek meaningful interactions with the environment and construct knowledge of themselves and the world around them through these interactions.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) And since mentioned previously that the majority of theories of developmental psychology focus on the importance of childhood and the many changes that occur during this period, (Mcleod, 2012) it is important to understand another factor related to developmental psychology – that children grow up to be adults that function in a society and sharing that society with other human beings.&lt;br /&gt;
In any and every society a variety of influences affect a human being in his or her outlook of the world, not to mention an exponential amount of influences related to genetics and biology that also affect a human being’s development. According to developmental psychology, this is known as the environment, or nature. And so developmental psychology seeks to explain how much of an impact environment, or nature, has in the role of the development of a human being. Perhaps human beings teach and raise children because of an innate need to express a lineage and a form of continuity of thought. Developmental psychology also seeks to explain how much of an impact human beings have upon others. Because there is a wide margin of differences between human beings and at the same time a form of consistency in the development of human beings, developmental psychology arose as a need to explain the impact of these factors and its relationships with human beings.&lt;br /&gt;
Specifically, this exposition of developmental psychology will too follow in the focus of the broader perspective and theories of developmental psychology – it will focus on childhood and the development thereof, and specifically two theories which explain the development of childhood between the first two years of life, the years of life between two and six, and the analyzing of the effects of cognitive, language, and social development of a child with the explanation of the two theories. Those two theories are the theories proposed by Vygotsky and Piaget.&lt;br /&gt;
Piaget was born in Switzerland. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Not only was he involved in the developmental psychology realm as a behavioral psychologist, he also was a biologist, and a philosopher. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) It was in the 1960’s and 1970’s that his theories became widely accepted. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) A self-described genetic epistemologist, he focused his work on how biology and the formation of how children think and act played a role on each other. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) This was his desire that he formed a general theory of such development. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) His work cannot be overstated. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) His theories were a profound change of the pattern of thought at the time, which viewed that children are just smaller versions of adults. (Cherry, 2006) And though he likely lived through the influence and impact of Freudian and Jungian psychology, Piaget took a different approach to the perspective of the development of children. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, not all of his theories rejected Freudian psychology – (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) specifically that the development of children could be explained in a series of stages. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) However, Piaget differs from Freudian psychology in that the repression of sexuality in the development of a human being is largely ignored and instead Piaget proposes that children are active learners engaged in the adding and modifying of cognitive structures, which are, according to Piaget, known as schemas. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2015) His second theory is the development of a model of cognitive developmental stages. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004)&lt;br /&gt;
Schemas are the “mental and physical actions involved in understanding and knowing.” (Cherry, 2006) Inside this schema are two further concepts: the category of knowledge and the process of obtaining that knowledge. (Cherry, 2006) These two concepts can be summarized as the process of adaption. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Specifically, adaptation is “predicated on the belief that the building of knowledge is a continuous activity of self-construction; as a person interacts with the new environment, knowledge is invented and manipulated into cognitive structures.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) When a “discrepancy” is found in the environment, a human being, according to Piaget, resorts to one of two facilities: assimilation or accommodation. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Assimilation is the process by which the perception of the environment is changed to fit the mold of a previously existing schema, or structure of understanding of cognitive thought by which a person navigates the world. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) The second facility is known as accommodation, which is that the actual schema, or the previously mentioned structure of cognitive thought, is changed or modified to fit a new way of understanding the environment. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Whatever way is chosen, the path is chosen by way of interaction with the environment. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) This decision occurs as a result of a desire to reach a harmony of understanding between the environment and the existing mental schema, (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) or the “force which moves development along.” (Mcleod, 2007) This process of equilibrium is not a progressive state that develops in a linear fashion. (Mcleod, 2007) Instead, this process moves in “leaps and bounds.” (Mcleod, 2007) To further explain equilibrium an example can be given. A human being experiences disequilibrium, or an unpleasant state of being, when an existing mental schema does not match with the environment that was experienced by the human. (Mcleod, 2007) This learning process, equilibrium, or the desire to depart of an unpleasant state of existence, drives along learning because human beings “do not like to be frustrated” and “will seek to restore balance by mastering the new challenge (accommodation). (Mcleod, 2007) Once the equilibrium is achieved again through the process of assimilation into the new mental schema, or through the process of accommodation, the new schema continues until change is required. (Mcleod, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
The second portion of Piaget’s theory of development has to do with his model of cognitive development. There are four pieces of cognitive development according to Piaget: the sensorimotor stage, the pre-operational stage, the concrete stage, and the formal operational stage. (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, every child goes through these four stages in the same order. (Mcleod, 2007) Differences in the development relates to “biological maturation and interaction with the environment.” (Mcleod, 2007) According to Piaget, though no stages can be left out, there are differences in the timing, or rate of the succession of the model, some individuals never graduate past a certain level, particularly the latter stages. (Mcleod, 2007) In all four of these stages, according to Piaget, there are three types of knowledge that are present. They are, physical, logical-mathematical, and social. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) All three of these types of knowledge are gained from interaction with the environment. This means that these non-hierarchical processes are at work in all four of the hierarchical stages of development in Piaget’s model. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004)&lt;br /&gt;
The sensorimotor stage lasts from birth to age two. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) The use of symbols is not involved in the process by which the infant navigates the world. Instead, the infant depends on physical and motor activity. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) This is the main form of interaction for the infant. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Around the period of seven months, an infant may begin to understand the concept of object permanence, which is that objects can exist even if they are not physically seen. This requires the ability to understand abstract concepts. The second stage is the preoperational stage. This begins at around age two and ends around age seven. Symbolic thinking is becoming to be unlocked and the toddler now understands that symbols, words or pictures can be used to represent objects. (Cherry, 2006) Toddlers are still egocentric and struggle to take the view of others. (Cherry, 2006) This can be witnessed through the one way style of communication that toddlers express, or a lack of exchange of information. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Language use is becoming more prevalent. Pretend play can be witnessed since the use of imagination and memory has been a developing feature. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Although logic is slowly forming, a child’s ability to handle logic is mostly “monological”, or that they can only understand one aspect of a logical problem at a time. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) The third stage is the concrete operational stage which lasts from around seven to eleven years. The concept of constancy, which the toddler had previously struggled with in the preoperational stage, is now fully developed in the concrete operational stage. (Cherry, 2006) That is, that constancy having to do with the ability to understand that different sizes relating to volume and mass do not have so much to do with shape. For example, when a glass of water of equal volume is poured into two cups, the infant tends to choose the taller cup believing that the taller cup holds more liquid though the volumes of both the short and tall cup are the same. Egocentrism begins to disappear. (Cherry, 2006) Though logic is becoming more developed, abstract and hypothetical concepts are still struggled with. (Cherry, 2006) Furthermore, a child begins to understand that the thoughts he or she holds can be unique to him or her and that those same thoughts are not always shared with by others. (Cherry, 2006) Finally, the fourth stage of Piaget’s model of cognitive development is the formal operational stage, which lasts from 12 and throughout adulthood. At this stage young children and young adults are beginning to “think more about moral, philosophical, ethical, social, and political issues that require theoretical and abstract reasoning.” (Cherry, 2006) The ability to “see multiple potential situations” is developed. Sometimes a type of egocentric thinking reoccurs. (Think of the moody, “Woe is me” teenager stage.) Intelligence is shown through the use of “logical symbols related to abstract concepts.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) This stage is not always achieved – it was shown in later experiments. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Researchers Eylon and Linn categorized high school students according to Piaget’s developmental model and found that “most students have not attained formal operations stage by the time they get out of high school, let alone at age fifteen when Piaget states that most young people should have attained it.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Furthermore, Piaget stressed the importance of the difference between qualitative information and quantitative information related to these stages of development. That is, that information is not quantitative, or that information is not constantly being added to a child, but rather than the information is qualitative, or that the information simply becomes higher quality. (Cherry, 2006)&lt;br /&gt;
Lev Semenovich Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist that lived through the Russian Revolution. (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Though the final work of Vygotsky did not reach full, worldwide recognition until around 1962 when his work was fully published, (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) his work was recognized, renowned, and influential in what now called Social Development Theory. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky’s theory holds that “no single principle can account for development.” (Mcleod, 2008) Furthermore, individual development “cannot be understood without reference to the social and cultural context within which it is embedded.” (Mcleod, 2008) Even higher metal processes are caused as a result of social processes. (Mcleod, 2008) So it is the social interaction with what is defined by Vygotsky as “More Knowledgeable Other”, or “MKO” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) that cognitive development is advanced in children. To quote Vygotsky in his own words, “the development of the mind is the interweaving of biological development of the human body and the appropriation of cultural/ideal/material heritage which exists in the present to coordinate people with each other and the physical world.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Shortly put, according to Vygotsky, social interaction is the backbone, or framework, “for all learning and development”. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004)&lt;br /&gt;
His work can be divided into three major parts or principles. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) The first principle is that social interaction progresses cognitive development. It is critical. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) It goes as far as what is learned and what is not learned. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Second, cognitive development is limited to a certain time span. Third and finally, Vygotsky claims that humans learn anything about anything because the process of learning itself is developed, rather than the object being learned. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) These principles combine together abstractly to form a general purpose of thought that is that society and culture impact cognitive development. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) Vygotsky believed that there is a form of filtering between cognitive thought and social occurrences that finally “integrates into the individuals thinking through the use of language”, (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) which is a social process. This process, or what Vygotsky calls dialectical discovery, becomes more complex over time, which essentially states that “all higher functions originate as actual interpersonal relationships between individuals.” (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) This higher function cognitive thinking, or very important types of learning, (Mcleod, 2008) comes through the interaction of a tutor. This tutor could “model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child”. (Mcleod, 2008) This is called cooperative or collaborative dialogue. (Mcleod, 2008) This cooperative thinking or collaborative thinking is further explained through the use of two concepts: the influence of the MKO, or “more knowledgeable other”, and the ZPD or the “zone of proximal development.” MKO was mentioned earlier and further conveyed with the concept of the tutor. However, the tutor does not always have to be a teacher or an older adult. Sometimes the MKO can be the peers, or it could simply be a machine that teaches the child. Regardless of the shape or form of the MKO, the MKO plays a role in the pouring of knowledge and cognitive development in the child. The ZPD or zone of proximal development is integrated into the MKO. That is, the ZPD explains an abstract or conceptual distance between what a child can learn on his or her own, the most inner circle, what the child can learn with help, or the middle circle, and the outer circle, which is what cannot be learned by the child currently, or beyond his or her reach. (Mcleod, 2008) What allows an individual to reach to the middle circle, or what can be learned with help, is through the use of scaffolding, (Mcleod, 2008) or the temporary support given to a child by a MKO, in order to “enable the child to perform a task until such time that child can already perform the task independently.” (Psychology Notes HQ, 2018) Both Piaget and Vygotsky’s theories continue to be influential in the field of developmental psychology due to the numerous amount of research achieved by the above mentioned theorists, (Mcleod, 2012) contributing more clues in order to understand large challenges presented to developmental psychology and psychology in general, which in this case is, the question of how much nature vs. nurture, stability vs. change, and continuity vs. discontinuity impacts the development of a human being. (Mcleod, 2012)&lt;br /&gt;
There is a difference between Vygotsky and Piaget’s view of development of children. Piaget first says that around from birth to two years of age a stage of cognitive development exists. (Lutz &amp;amp; Huitt, 2004) So too, loosely, does Vygotsky. (Blunden, 2011) However, instead of the age being from birth to two for the first stage and from two to six for the second stage, Vygotsky claims that there is no stage for models of cognitive development but that instead there are periods of stable development mark with periods of crisis at the ages of 1, 3, 7, 13, and 17. (Blunden, 2011) Furthermore, Vygotsky is more focused on the learning processes of the child whereas Piaget’s theory focuses more on the development of the child. (Mcleod, 2007) And while Vygotsky’s perspective applies to all types of learners, Piaget’s theory focuses only on children. (Mcleod, 2007) So in regards to the sensorimotor stage, Piaget viewed that the child learned to navigate the world through the use of motor reflexes and physical sensation. (Mcleod, 2007) Object Permanence is gradually obtained. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, a period of crisis occurs at birth, twelve months, age three, seven, and thirteen. For Vygotsky a driving force of development through these crises is the result of “a gap between the child’s manifest needs and the current social means of their satisfaction.” (Blunden, 2011) For Piaget, the sensorimotor stage from birth to two, and the preoperational stage from two to seven, and the last two stages of his theory of cognitive development, graduation between these stages is not explained, only assumed. (Mcleod, 2007) For Vygotsky, children develop through a crisis in which then help is supplemented to the child by a MKO or through scaffolding. (Blunden, 2011) Thus through these crises Vygotsky creates a form of description of age levels for children. (Blunden, 2011) And actually this chart is marked by the use of cognitive ability and a heavier emphasis of language through the help of other people on the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Where Piaget makes an assumption based on his research that object permanence is a concept that is sooner or later obtained in the sensorimotor stage, Vygotsky makes no claim whatsoever to the concept of object permanence. And while Piaget had created a model of stages of development based on age, Vygotsky rather makes no model for development and seems to imply the development is a continuous process. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget’s preoperational stage of development, from year two to seven, describes object constancy – Vygotsky says nothing of object constancy. (Cherry, 2006) While Piaget makes reference to the use of language becoming preeminent in the toddler, Vygotsky makes a heavy emphasis on language throughout all parts of the development of the child. (Blunden, 2011) Piaget takes a heavier emphasis on the peer-to-peer interactions as the motor to social perspective taking, whereas Vygotsky claims that it is instead that the role of the adult that equips a child with intellectual adaption via cultural tools that children internalize. (Mcleod, 2008) The biggest difference between Piaget and Vygotsky in the role of cognitive development is that Vygotsky places large emphasis if not all emphasis on the role of societal influences on the developing child whereas the Piaget theory states that it is instead the role of a child’s independent exploration and construction of their own world that influences cognitive development. (Mcleod, 2008) Vygotsky saw that language development occurred separately from thought and that they merge at around age three, thereby producing what Vygotsky called verbal thought, or inner speech. (Mcleod, 2008) Piaget theorized instead that thought preceded language and that language depended on thought for development. (Mcleod, 2008) Whereas for Piaget the sensorimotor and preoperational stages of cognitive development are universal, i.e. object permanence and object constancy occur at the same levels of development though at varying rates, Vygotsky would have rejected the theory in the view that instead the cognitive development of a child and of such concepts as object permanency and constancy are rather instead dependent upon societal and cultural factors. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally, all learning, social, cognitive, and language learning would have been, according to Piaget, must first develop in the theoretical stages of cognitive development, whereas Vygotsky would have claimed that “learning is a necessary and universal aspect of the process of developing culturally organized, specifically human psychological function.” (Mcleod, 2008)&lt;br /&gt;
Because of the numerous factors involved in the development of a child, perhaps an exponential if not infinite amount of variables involved in this process, it may be best to view the various theories of developmental psychology as a framework of understanding in order to guide a researcher to more deeper understanding of the science of developmental psychology instead of a sort of myopia about Vygotsky or Piaget, incorrectly believing that one theorist holds the ultimate and final answer to the understanding of the development of humans. Perhaps both theorists would agree that the answer lies not in one or the other but a close immersion of both the theories and other future developmental theories to come. As much as we would like a key to life or various keys to life, it is usually a mixture of topics and understandings that bring us closer to the grander, more beautiful whole understanding of what the truth is. And the writer views this perspective as a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others”, said Dranafile Bojaxhiu to her daughter, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) What Dranafile said to Agnes must have left an impact on her because later Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu legacy would be that her order “included hundreds of centers in more than 90 countries with some 4,000 nuns and hundreds of thousands of lay workers.” (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Not only that, she grew to receive “…the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian honors”, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) being gifted Pope Paul VI’s ceremonial limousine and raffling it to finance her leper colony, (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018), and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) This is the story of Mother Theresa. Here I will describe Mother Theresa’s life through the use of three personality theories and the foundational elements in Mother Theresa’s life that would have steered her personality one way or another. The personality theories I will use will be the humanistic approach and the social learning approach. The four influences I will use to describe the development of Mother Theresa’s life will be as follows: the death of her father at age 9 and the subsequent influence her mother had on her life, the spiritual calling of her life at 12, becoming a nun at 18, and at 19 moving to India and the subsequent calling she received to go to Calcutta to reach to the poorest of the poor. Mother Theresa was born in Skopje, Macedonia on August 27, 1910. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) She was born in the last breaths of the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Macedonia at the time. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) Her mother and father were grocers. Her family was deeply religious (Biography.com Editors, 2018) and her father was “deeply involved” in both the local church as well as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence (Biography.com Editors, 2018), which was the source of Mother Theresa’s ethnicity. Her father had passed when Mother Theresa was the age of 9. While the source of Mother Theresa’s father’s death was not known, it was sudden and speculated at her father’s political enemies may have poisoned him. (Biography.com Editors, 2018)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother Theresa’s own mother also had a huge influence upon her life. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Her mother, Drana was known as a pious and compassionate woman. It was Drana who told then Agnes, “My child, my child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others” when Agnes asked who these strangers were in their house after Drana had invited the “destitute” (Biography.com Editors, 2018) of the city to dine with the family. Continuing, Drana said “Some of them are our relations, but all of them are our people.” Agnes also attended a convent-run primary school (Biography.com Editors, 2018) which along with Drana and Nikola, Agnes’ father, which may have set her on the path to a career in the spiritual realm. At 12 she received a calling into ministry. Specifically, her congregation made an annual trip to the Church of the Black Madonna, in Letnice. On one such trip she received her calling. At age 18, she left for Dublin, Ireland and she took the name Sister Mary Theresa.&lt;br /&gt;
Here, Mother Theresa’s extraordinary skill is portrayed. She taught for 17 years in Calcutta, India. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) She was specifically there to teach the poorest of the poor in Calcutta. Here she learned Bengali and Hindi while teaching geography and history. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) On May 24, 1937, Mother Theresa took her Final Professional of Vows which included a “life of poverty, chastity, and obedience. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) This was the event where Mother Theresa finally took the title of “mother”. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Here in Calcutta, at Saint Mary’s she continued teaching and eventually becoming the principle of the school.&lt;br /&gt;
While riding a train from Calcutta to the Himalayan foothills for a retreat, she received what became known as Mother Theresa’s “call within a call” where she says Jesus Christ spoke to her to leave teaching for helping the poorest of the poor. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) However, she needed to gain approval from the Vatican because she had taken a vow to obedience to the church. She finally took approval from the Vatican and she donned the blue and white sari that she became so famously known for. (Biography.com Editors, 2018) Here afterwards she founded an organization called the Missionaries of Charities which received official status as a religious community from the Archdiocese of Calcutta. This organization attracted many financial support as well as volunteers. (“Mother Teresa Biography”, 2018)) Not only did she help the poorest of the poor receive education, she also founded a leper community and an orphanage for abandoned children as well as a hospice for the terminally ill. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Her work received wide support and recognition from not only governments and organizations but also from the Pope himself. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) She did not attend her Nobel Peace prize ceremony but instead asked that the Nobel Peace prize fund be given to the poor. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
The final part of her life was marked with health problems. However, even all the while she was ailed with sickness and health problems; she continued to travel to her various organizations, the Missionaries of Charity to promote the organization’s cause to help the poor and needy. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018) She died within a week of Princess Diana’s death, another popular figure associated with the helping of the poor and needy. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018) Years after her death, her letters had surfaced which indicated that during the last 50 years of her life she had felt a distance from God and the suffering she experienced from that. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) However she never abandoned the faith and remained committed to God. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Posthumously and throughout her career as Mother Theresa, she was awarded many times over. Such examples include the Nobel Peace Prize, the Honorary Citizenship of the United States, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Nehru Prize, and the list continues. (“Biography Mother Teresa”, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Humanism is the study of the person, “the whole person, and the uniqueness of the individual.” (Mcleod, 2015) Both the psychodynamic and behavioral schools of psychology saw the individual as a byproduct of a series of deterministic events; with psychodynamic psychology the innate subconscious forces that drive the individual and with the view of behavioral psychology the result of the individual in the terms of both stimulus and response. (Mcleod, 2015) In humanistic psychology, the basic belief is that the individual is innately good, humans have free will in the form of personal agency, and emphasizes “the worth of the individual, centrality of human values, and the creative, active nature of human beings.” (Mcleod, 2015) The second emphasis that is important to humanism is the concept of self-actualization. Self-actualization deals with “psychological growth, fulfillment, and satisfaction in life”. (Mcleod, 2015) Furthermore, humanism deals with the belief that personal growth and fulfillment are basic to human motivation. (Mcleod, 2015) Both Rogers and Maslow, important figures in humanism, view differently how self-actualization is to be accomplished but the basic belief that self-actualization is the goal of an individual is the same. Mother Theresa is an excellent example of the need to self-actualize. She is also an excellent example of a human being that fits the “humans are innately good” perspective. Although Mother Theresa says she felt that by God she was called to ministry to help the poor and needy, it was through her own personal agency that she felt compelled to follow this call from God.&lt;br /&gt;
Observational learning is the bridge between classical and operant conditioning. This theory was proposed by Albert Bandura. (Mcleod, 2008) Onto these two learning theories he adds another two ideas: mediation occurs between stimulus and response and second, behavior is learned through observational learning. (Mcleod, 2008) There are 4 processes to the meditational process of behavioral learning. First phase is the attention phase. The behavior is noticed. (Mcleod, 2008) The second phase is the retention phase which is how well the behavior is remembered. (Mcleod, 2008) Third is the reproduction phase which is the ability to perform the behavior observed. (Mcleod, 2008) Finally is the motivation phase which is the fourth phase. In this phase the will to perform the behavior is noticed. Motivation to perform the behavior involves the processing of the rewards or risks involved with the behavior and whether or not the individual wishes to process and perform the behavior. (Mcleod, 2008) Mother Theresa’s both mother and father had social Christian perspectives. That is, they both went out to practice the application of Christianity in their own lives – her father in politics and Albanian independence, and her mother who would invite the entire city to dine at their own house, specifically the destitute. Mother Theresa, then Agnes, would have much to witness and positive influences to want to model.&lt;br /&gt;
Specifically, there are four influences in her life that may have directly influenced her to become the Mother Theresa we all so well know today. The four influences and events are, the passing of her father at age 9, the calling she received to go into ministry at 12, becoming a nun at 18, and moving to India at 19. Some of us may have memories of being a child at 9. This was for most of us third or fourth grade. Her father passed at this age and may well have left a mark on her knowing that her father was deeply devoted to God and to social work. Later, when she was older she would have also experienced and witnessed seeing her mother also deeply involved in the church and inviting people over that were not family and were practically strangers to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;
Although not much of her young life is known, it could be assumed that when she was younger Agnes would have seen much of her father and mother’s experiences of self-actualization at the work they were committing to in the name of the Lord. At 12 Agnes reports having had a calling by God to go into ministry. This may have been the fulfillment of her mother and father’s own legacy upon her. At 18, she took vows to become a nun and would likely have been around many other fellow believers that were self-actualizing and also portraying the positive intrinsic benefits to a life devoted to the Lord. When 19 and after having been in India for some time and having taken the title of “Mother” she would also have experienced the self-actualizing experience of her final vows to obedience to the Church and to God.&lt;br /&gt;
Being that humanism and social learning was applied toward the application of Mother Theresa, it would be appropriate to make an analysis of Mother Theresa regarding uniqueness vs. universality theories of human personality. Mother Theresa displayed many characteristics unique to the world and the impact she’s made thereof. Humanists would view that these traits were representative of her own unique ability manifested in her desire to self-actualize. Social learning theory, which is based in learning in regards to classical and operant conditioning, would argue that Mother Theresa was a product of her environment, given that she had grown up in a religious home. This would be a nurture effect of her life.&lt;br /&gt;
In the role of assessment through the perspective of social learning theory, it would be appropriate to see the relationship between Agnes and her mother and father. If her mother and father had both been around at the time and assessment was being conducted, we could see how much of an impact her parents had upon Mother Theresa’s life. For example, what if her father had not died at the age of 9 – would she still have become a nun? And suppose that both her mother and father were not religious at all? Would she still have become the great Mother Theresa after having had an experience in which she felt God was calling her to ministry? In the perspective of humanism, qualitative study would have been made, since humanism rejects scientific methodology. (Mcleod, 2015) This involves the use of diaries and open ended questions. Mother Theresa would have been asked to make a journal of her personal thoughts and would have been asked questions concerning her father’s death and her mother’s devotion to religious views.&lt;br /&gt;
The four adjustment issues that Mother Theresa could have faced are as follows: stress from the initial stage of her ministry from having to beg for money and supplies in order to fulfill her ministry’s needs, frustration in the latter part of her life from feeling like God had abandoned her, according to her letters, conflict in the world from where she was criticized for her anti-abortion views (Biography.com Editors, 2018), and decision making through the issue of self-image when she was a girl and taking vows towards sisterhood. Mother Theresa overcame many of these conflicts, from the view of a humanist, through the drive to self-actualize and to express the unique individuality in her personal calling from God to overcome her obstacles. Social learning theory would express the idea that the decision making of her choice to become a nun was through the experience of having witnessed the religious devotion of her parents.&lt;br /&gt;
Mother Theresa’s life was filled with self-sacrifice and devotion to the poorest of the poor in India. As a result of this, she was recognized and made a saint in the church only two years after her death. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Mother Theresa would make an excellent subject of explanation of her life through the lens of humanism. She fits the mold of the humanist’s view that humans are essentially good and have personal agency. Social learning theory however, is limited in the case of Mother Theresa because of the lack of detailed information regarding her young childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PSY321 Statistics for Behavioral Sciences (Relationship on social media vs. GPA)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy321-statistics-for-behavioral-sciences/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy321-statistics-for-behavioral-sciences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
Hypothesis 1: Students that have lower GPAs (Less than 3.0) tend to spend more than 10 hours a week on social media.&lt;br /&gt;
Hypothesis 2: Students that say that they use social media during class tend to have GPAs lower than a 3.0.&lt;br /&gt;
Probability question: If a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0?&lt;br /&gt;
For the first hypothesis, it would appear that there is a relationship between a GPA of less than 3.0 and spending more than 10 hours a week on social media. Of the 25 students, 12 of the students were found to have less than a 3.0 GPA and having spent more than 10 hours a week on social media. This was a rate of 48%.&lt;br /&gt;
In the second hypothesis, the data regarding the amount of students that say they use social media during classroom time and having less than a 3.0 GPA was found that 7 of the 25 students met this criterion at a rate of 28%.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the based on the data for probability, only 3 of the 25 students were found to have met the criteria of having spent less than 20 hours a week and having a GPA higher than a 3.0 at a sample rate of 12%. The initial impressions of this probability seem low in general – there does not appear to be a strong relationship between academia and low social media usage. Perhaps it’s a generational issue and time spent wasted elsewhere is instead for these students spent mostly just on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;
GPA, right skew (Std. Deviation @ .58332):&lt;br /&gt;
(http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)&lt;br /&gt;
GPA is mostly centered around slightly less than 3.0, while the right skew implies that the 2nd majority of students are somewhere in between the range of 3.2 to 3.6 GPA.&lt;br /&gt;
Number of close friends, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 5.1951):&lt;br /&gt;
(http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)&lt;br /&gt;
The majority of students have anywhere from 0-4 friends or 5-9 friends, making this a heavily left leaning skew. What is interesting to note here is that there is only one student of twenty five that mentioned having friends of 20-24.&lt;br /&gt;
Number of school activities, right skew (Std. Deviation @ 2.138) (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)&lt;br /&gt;
The majority of students were found to have 4-5 school activities making this chart a right leaning skew.&lt;br /&gt;
Average number of hours spent on social media each week, left skew (Std. Deviation @ 27.343006): (http://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/histograms/Default.aspx)&lt;br /&gt;
Confidence interval of the first variable, GPA, is a population mean between 2.76 and 3.22.&lt;br /&gt;
Confidence interval of the second variable, the amount of time spent on social media, is populations mean that is between 28.1 and 49.5.&lt;br /&gt;
Based upon the original probability assumption made, that is, “if a student spends less than 20 hours of social media a week, what is the likelihood that that student’s GPA is at least a 3.0?”, we can conclude safely that this chance of occurrence is actually very low due to the sampling given. There are not enough students that have a high GPA with less than 20 hours of social media a week and there are too many students that have a high GPA, that is, greater than a 3.0 that also spend much more than 20 hours a week on social media. This probability at around 12%, means that probably the secondary hypothesis ought to be rejected in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br /&gt;
Although the original hypothesis was designed to predict GPA scores and social media usage, specifically that social media usage was and low GPA was positively correlated, however the data supposes that there is no relationship between these two factors. In fact, there were many more evidences of data that conclude that many students are able to manage social media usage and to maintain a GPA greater than a 3.0, even for students that have claimed to have used social media while in the classroom. Based upon this study, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that social media has a negative effect upon GPA. This study concludes that because there is no evidence to suggest that social media has a negative effect upon GPAs, it should be allowed for the students to have access to social media during certain points of the day. However, the matter of whether or not the platform by which the social media is accessed, for example, a cellphone is a distraction for students is another data point which ought to be surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PSY312 Lifespan Development Final Project (Observation of myself in the light of life span developmental theory)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy312-lifespan-development/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bronfenfenner’s theory is based upon an idea of ecological theory. Ecological theory is the idea that “human development is inseparable from the environmental contexts in which a person develops.” In essence, this idea is that human beings develop in a complex set of networks. These networks are comprised of varying levels of intimacy – from as intimate as a child’s parents or siblings to as distant as an ethnic group of peoples that share values and outlooks. These networks are all correlated and in the ecological theory the idea is that there is a hierarchy of influence between the lower or upper, or intimate to un-intimate relationships. These hierarchies or varying levels of intimacy, or as ecological theorists call levels of influence, are all interconnected in complex ways. In order to understand this concept, I have considered an example for the reader. Consider a rainbow. How many colors are in a rainbow? Seven? I propose to the reader to consider at what point does red become orange? At what point does the gradient between yellow become green? I believe this demonstrates in a crude sort of way the complexities between the levels of influence in ecological theory. The established levels of ecological theory according to Bronfenfenner or any other ecological theorist is established for the sake of categorizing established levels so that there can be a form of a basis of measurement for the reader and myself to understand.&lt;br /&gt;
This basis should help us to understand the complexities involved in the variety of influences in the development of the lives of human beings. Bronfenfenner has established four levels of influence according to his perspective of ecological theory. They are as follows: microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems. The microsystem “consists of people and objects in an individual’s immediate environment.” This level strongly influrnces development. Consider the parents or siblings. (Kail, 2014) The mesosystem “provides connections across microsystems because what happens in a microsystem is likely to influence others.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of the interconnections between work life responsibilities and home life responsibilities. (Kail, 2014) It is easy to imagine that sometimes a stressful day at work can carry over into your home life when you come home and you still feel the pressures of managing your work life while you are at home. The Exosystem “refers to the social settings that a person may not experience firsthand but that still influence development.” (Kail, 2014) Kail uses the example of government policies influencing an individual’s life, and he uses the example of a participant using welfare. (Kail, 2014) Also consider too if there were to be a war that breaks out somewhere in another country and because the government feels the need is great for more people to serve in this war, it could mandate a draft which would, if the individual were a male, change that person’s life very quickly, though he has no real personal interactions with this government like he would have potentially had with his parents or siblings. Finally, the macrosystem. “The broadest environmental context is the macrosystem, the cultures and subcultures in which the microsystem, mesosystem, and exosystem are embedded.” (Kail, 2014) Consider the outlook on life that an ethnic group collectively share. Expressions of bereavement are different amongst the different cultures as well as ideas and roles of filial relations or of gender roles.&lt;br /&gt;
According to ecological theory, these relationships are all interconnected in almost infinite amount of combinations depending upon the individual. It is probably not possible to list all of them and how they all influence a person’s individual development, however it is possible to gain a general idea of a person’s development through the use of categorization in which different levels of development can be “split” or attributed into sections. In Bronfenfenner’s case, it is four levels, splits, or categories of attributes. Perhaps now it is easier for the reader to see the levels of from friends, family, and siblings to as far reaching as culture and religious outlooks from a civilizational perspective.&lt;br /&gt;
From the microsystem perspective, I was raised to be working nearly always. My father wakes up at 3:00 in the morning and comes home at 7:30 in the evening. This routine has continued for nearly 30 years. He does not intend to stop. He has placed upon me a desire to want to work, and that work is good. I also have a younger sister that is 8 years younger than me. I was like a second father to her, so I was also raised inadvertently as a man that has had experience with development of a younger person since I was constantly asked to take care of my sister through babysitting or picking her up from her school. My sister and I don’t have a friendly relationship because we are not necessarily friends, but the love is great between her and I in a deep way because of the time I spent taking care of her.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes after a long day of work I come home and I still feel stressed so I will have an alcoholic drink. Although I should be learning to better manage work-life stress sometimes I come home and cope with it in a way that I feel is not beneficial to me. But every day these actions lead to a conclusion in my life. So on the days that I learn to better manage my work-life stress I find that I learn that I can be more resilient with life in general. This is good for me, and I feel that this has a strong level of development in who I am as a person, shaping my personality as well as my character. This is my mesosystem of influence.&lt;br /&gt;
When I obtained my citizenship, I joined the military. I had a sense of patriotic pride for my new country so I felt the need to “serve my country”. If I had obtained my citizenship in a different country where serving in the military is not considered a patriotic thing to do, I am doubtful I would have joined the military as I did when I obtained my citizenship. Also, when Congress approves a budget increase for the military and therefore I receive a pay raise of around 5%, I also benefit from this situation. Increased money allows me just a little bit more freedom in my life. Direct policy changes in the government have major effects upon my life. This is the exosystem of influence in my life.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally the macrosystem. I am ethnically a Korean. So that means I have a specific outlook on life and family that is unique to my culture and ethnic group. For example, I am expected to live with my parents in the same house even while I am married. This is a big difference for Americans. Also, I have noticed that Koreans mourn for the loss of their loved ones in a specific way. There is a lot of weeping, sobbing, and perhaps in the view of an American, a form of hysteria. This is considered acceptable in Korean culture, and in fact it may be considered strange if one were act in a manner of stoicism like in Western funerals.&lt;br /&gt;
Erikson’s theory of development is based off of the psychodynamic theory. This theory has its basis of knowledge from Sigmund Freud. (Kail, 2014) Kail says, “…psychodynamic theories hold that development is largely determined by how well people resolve conflicts they face at different ages.” Sigmund Freud’s theory of personality development was based on the idea that “personality emerges from conflicts that children experience between what they want to do and what society wants them to do.” (Kail, 2014) Erikson elaborated on this in that “Erikson proposed that personality development is determined by the interaction of an internal maturational plan and external societal demands.” (Kail, 2014) In Erikson’s theory, there are eight stages in his particular theory of life cycle. (Kail, 2014) These stages are trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and ego integrity vs. despair.&lt;br /&gt;
Trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, and initiative vs. guilt are the first three levels of development that occur in a young developing child. In the trust vs. mistrust stage, an infant learns to trust his or herself and learns to trust others. Erikson also theorizes that an infant also learns the concept of hope through the experience of mistrust and trust, “an openness to new experience tempered by wariness that discomfort or danger may arise.” (Kail, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
In autonomy vs. doubt, children understand they can control their actions. (Kail, 2014) Here the autonomy is also countered by the child’s self-doubt in whether he or she can or cannot handle a situation by his or herself. Erikson says that the child learns the concept of will during this stage, which is “a young child’s understanding that he or she can act on the world intentionally, which occurs when autonomy, shame, and doubt are in balance.” (Kail, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
In initiative vs. guilt, children learn to explore their environment. (Kail, 2014) This includes asking questions and imagining possibilities. (Kail, 2014) They also hold guilt since their initiative could conflict with the initiatives of others. (Kail, 2014) Here, a child learns purpose, which is “achieved with a balance between individual initiative and willingness to cooperate with others.” (Kail, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;
Industry vs. Inferiority is when the child learns specific skills like writing or mathematics. The child learns that he or she can learn skills and to be good at them, while at the same time if the child fails in this development he or she feels a sense of inferiority in being unable to accomplish tasks. This is the stage where a child learns the virtue of competence.&lt;br /&gt;
Identity vs. role confusion is a stage where adolescents to teenagers begin to learn their identities versus identities pushed on them by parents, peers, or society. (Mcleod, 2013) Children are learning to fit in society. In this stage, the child learns the concept of fidelity, which is to “commit one’s self to others on the basis of accepting others, even when there may be ideological differences.” (Mcleod, 2013) During this period of learning who they are, they may develop role confusion as a result of a failure to find an identity. (Mcleod, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
Intimacy vs. isolation occurs from 18 to 40, where the individual learns to develop intimate relationships or isolation. This stage of Erikson’s theory develops the virtue of love. (Mcleod, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
In generativity vs. stagnation, careers, families, and relationships become solidified. (Mcleod, 2013) If an individual fails in this stage, he or she becomes unproductive, or stagnant. (Mcleod, 2013) This develops the virtue of care. (Mcleod, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
The final stage is the ego integrity vs. despair stage. From 65+ onwards, the individual makes an assessment of his or her life and finds that life was fully accomplished in the way the individual desired or finds that life was lived short of the goals the individual had envisioned, leading to despair. (Mcleod, 2013) This stage produces the virtue of wisdom, which “enables a person to look back on their life with a sense of closure and completeness, and also accept death without fear.” (Mcleod, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
The first three stages of my life involved infancy to becoming a self-aware child. My mother breastfed me and kept me close to her side as often as possible. During these three stages I can recall a story my mother told me. She said when I was sitting in the shopping cart, I would take groceries to hand to the clerk and ask “how much” for as many items as I could. I also remember my parents allowing me to play as I wished, and having put a battery in my mouth and feeling the electrical charge from the battery, I felt embarrassed to have done what I must have thought was a silly thing.&lt;br /&gt;
In the industry vs. inferiority stage, I remember having to be left home alone whenever it was possible. The first day I was left home alone as a result of my parents having to work nearly 80 something hours each week, I remember feeling a sense of despair as I looked out the window, waiting for my mother to return, even though it had only been a few minutes since she had left. But I do also remember getting to a certain point in this stage of my life where I was able to take care of myself as I was left home alone, to the point where I made my own meals through the microwave, played computer games, and eventually fell asleep to awake to my parents coming back home. Although I had not known it, I had a feeling of a sense of mastery in being left home alone because I remember a sense of casualness I had from being alone, even to the point of where I began to prefer that environment.&lt;br /&gt;
In the identity vs. role confusion, I remember that my family had to move around frequently during this stage of my life because of my parents starting and failing many small businesses. I moved around a lot and found I had very few friends. I remember also asking my friends during the fourth grade if they thought I was more of a skater or more of a punk, trying to fit into certain clichés I felt I had or wanted to fit into. This stage involved me buying skating shoes and trying to buy certain kinds of t-shirts I felt were appropriate to who I was. I recall a large sense of pressure to try to fit in and to find a group of people that I felt I could associate with. In the end, I found that I was more of an individual rather than a person who identified with a group. I find that now I don’t identify so much with groups as much as I do with people who share the same ideas and outlooks on life. Furthermore, I feel I’ve developed a sense of fidelity because though I have a strong sense of what I think is right and wrong, I have begun to learn to accept others and their ideas, even if I feel they are incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;
Intimacy vs. isolation is where I am currently in my life. I have not had a meaningful relationship with a significant other in many years, and due to my frequent moving, I have not maintained many friendships. I am also quick to reject friends if I feel they are burdening me or if I feel they are incorrect in their perspectives in life. Part of this reason for rejection is because I feel that I want to surround myself with people that I feel are similar to me and my outlooks. However, I have maintained three or four friends now that I feel are similar to my outlook on life and I am learning to open up and to share with them. Luckily also I have the church that I go to and I develop, to me, very intimate relationships from bible study and Christian fellowship. This is a great way to bond with people that I feel are on the same page with me. I am still developing the virtue of love.&lt;br /&gt;
Generativity vs. stagnation and ego integrity vs. despair is where I will group these stages in life together because one, I am not there yet and two, since I am not there yet I can speak briefly on where I am currently headed since sooner or later I will reach this stage in my life. I am in the military and though the work is unfulfilling, I am satisfied with the work I do in my life because I maintain an active lifestyle. I go to church every Sunday and I am involved in a small group discussion group where I try my best to volunteer my time and to help to develop others in their faith. Second, I am attending college and I am also going to jiu-jitsu about five days a week. So I am very busy with work related to my personal life, and I feel in these aspects of personal life I feel much fulfilled. And because I try to maintain friendships where I can best live a life I feel is honest and filled with integrity, perhaps I will be lucky enough to be able to look back at my life with what I felt was a sense of truthful living.&lt;br /&gt;
The similarities between Erikson and Kohlberg are that both Erikson and Kohlberg separate the development of an individual into categories. However, that is about as far as the similarities go between Erikson and Kohlberg. Kohlberg’s categorization of the development of an individual are split into categories to understand a person’s development of morality. Where Erikson emphasizes the experience of the development of an individual through events as well as interactions with people, Kohlberg emphasizes the same development through the emphasis on people and societal expectations. Where Erikson views emphasizes development of a person’s character and outlook on life, Kohlberg’s theory is based strictly on morality. However, they can be used in conjunction with each other when analyzing the development of a person’s character, outlook, and morality.&lt;br /&gt;
My morality probably could be more effectively explained through Kohlberg’s development of morality. For example, I can remember when I was around 17 or 18 and learning to organize a music band together for church. In this setting I was learning to juggle the needs of many different band members as well as church faculty. In this environment I could have chosen to have been authoritarian, utilizing a “my way or the highway” attitude, however I managed to stumble upon the attitude that I was to work in efficient and harmonious like environments where everyone was to include their input and to be made valuable. This is probably because of the fact that I was in a church environment so I know I am held to a higher standard of what I ought to be doing and ought not to be doing, specifically on how I should be treating people. In this relationship with the music band members I found I was able to get along with others as well as work to satisfy the needs of members, like working around their time schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Future Need for Online Learning&lt;br /&gt;
As the global population around the world continues to swell, the need for nontraditional methods of learning will also grow in demand. Our university currently does not offer online courses. The reported satisfaction of online learning is high and positively correlated with convenience and the perception of value of service. (Sanford, et al. 2017) Students with nontraditional learning backgrounds will need a university that provides for them this service. Our university can satisfy the needs of these students with an online service that provides for such students while at the same time fulfilling faculty and staff satisfaction knowing that a high quality service is being provided to students who appreciate the convenience of learning outside of the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
Introduction to Study Proposal of Satisfaction of Students Who Already Take Courses Online&lt;br /&gt;
Students that take online courses are specific as to the reasons of perceived value of their education. They view convenience as a major factor of satisfaction of their online learning education. (Sanford, et al. 2017) This satisfaction, predictably, falls proportionate to the convenience factor when students report stress from work related demands. There was little to no relationship between learning styles and satisfaction of online learning. Regardless of the broad range of learning styles among students, the factor that led to satisfaction reports was the perception of high value. This is good news for the university. The need for online educational systems is not based upon the course itself but rather of the ability of the university to deliver convenience to the student as well as the ability to derive from the learning platform the university utilizes a perception of high value to the student. (Simmons, 2006)&lt;br /&gt;
What then to the university that does not yet provide a service to these students? First, a consideration to be made for such a university: What defines a high quality service? Simmons quotes Gonroos (1988) of the concept of quality in the distinction between technical quality and functional quality using the example of an airline transporting the luggage of its passenger. Simmons says the technical quality would be the function of the luggage properly reaching the point of destination. Functional quality in that the contents of the luggage being considered, for example, if there was china or perishable items in the luggage. (Simmons, 2006) How can a university consider this function of quality of service in regards to the delivery methods of an online course?&lt;br /&gt;
Second, it would appear that the course itself holds no weight to the perception of satisfaction to students. Whether it is calculus or English, students rather seem to focus on the convenience factor, whether it is in a face to face classroom or through an online learning platform. After all, students who attend in traditional means will attempt to schedule the classes around a convenient means to the students own schedule that allows for the student to balance work, life, and schooling as well as the minimizing of course “busywork”. (Sanford, et al. 2017) The question of course “busywork” applies not only to traditional learning but also to the online platform. The question of whether or not to include to the university’s program an online program seems to bring to surface another question – how can universities maintain academic credibility while at the same time reducing the total amount of coursework that may be considered by students to be “busywork”? But, such a question is for another topic of study.&lt;br /&gt;
Both studies cited here make the case for convenience and quality of service. Our university can take advantage of the opportunity for the growing need for online learning platforms. Soon, students all over the world will be accessing the internet and entering digital classrooms in which learning is done online. The universities that move with this progression of technology and education will be the ones who are left standing.&lt;br /&gt;
Rationale&lt;br /&gt;
The rationale for this study is first under the assumption that the university has indeed decided to move forward with the decision to create an online learning division. This research proposal focuses on the university delivering educational content on a platform that competes with other universities that already provide for excellent services for students. A research study should be done on the types of learning platforms that offer convenience to the students. The study should also research the necessary educational goals and components that offer the student a fulfilling and in-depth approach to the course. The study should also include what parts of other competing online curriculum are not necessary to the educational goals of the student and merely overburden the student with the previously mentioned “busywork”. Also, the study ought to clearly define the meaning of convenience and quality of value for the purposes of not only the student, but also for the university.&lt;br /&gt;
The study provides a clear destination for the university in the designing of an online curriculum. There are many different companies that build educational platforms on which a university can deliver courses. Which platform is best? And, if the research done by the university also agrees with the research of Sanford and Simmons, then should the universities altogether scrap the existing online learning platforms and instead build its own online learning platform? And finally, what of budget concerns? The study of satisfaction of students who take online courses ought to outweigh the costs associated with the building of an online course curriculum. The study should provide clarity of the cost to benefit analysis of creating such a course.&lt;br /&gt;
Method&lt;br /&gt;
The sample should include all who are by age, eligible to take online courses. This random but cross-sectional study will survey students who answer in a Likert format the reasons why a student chose his or her classes, the desire to take online courses, and the satisfaction of courses a student has that attends the university. Furthermore, the study should include international students. The size of the sample shall be anywhere from the list of students attending the university as well as the information that can be derived from other learning platforms that mine data from the activities of students that attend online colleges.&lt;br /&gt;
Sampling procedure follows surveys that are taken from students who already attend online college courses. Surveys can be taken from students who are in a traditional classroom by assigning the survey at the end of the day. Both surveys can be identified by the last four digits of the student’s social security.&lt;br /&gt;
Demographic information about a student can be taken by offering that information to be completed by the students who take the survey. Those that attend college vary by demographic but one speculates as to whether the demographic of interest of those who wish to attend an online college are older in age, possibly from 35-45. But, the collection of information based upon demographics of those who are in the later stages of life is dependent upon the university in which direction is wishes to go in terms of whether the university will cater to older adults or to a broad spectrum of students of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;
Sampling was excluded from this study because generalizations were not to be made from the population. This study seeks to base information of whether or not the university shall create an online classroom based upon already existing sources of information as to whether or not the cost outweighs the benefits and if the overall satisfaction of the student who takes online courses will be worth the cost of the creation of said online classroom. Finally, the focus is on the delivery of a online college that delivers that satisfaction to the student – whether it is indeed truly based upon the factors of convenience of if it is based upon the factors of the delivery of quality of service, or both.&lt;br /&gt;
Design&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed design for the study would be a qualitative research design with within-subjects as the research design. This type of research design is typical for research groups who want to for example, find the effectiveness of a program.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the type of question and method of survey was briefly mentioned earlier, this section will elaborate on the topic. The survey will be designed around a Likert-format. Questions will be asked as to whether or not a student agrees or disagrees with the convenience of the class he or she is currently taking. Such questions will include: “The amount of time you spend in class is worth your time”, and “I have trouble managing my life around my class schedule”, or in an online context, “I am not very motivated to finish my online assignments”. However, the majority of information that can be derived from the online portion of a survey can usually be found through a company’s learning platform. Usually these companies include surveys at the end of each class. Patten University, for example, offers such surveys. The university can pay for the informational data and use it in conjunction with the surveys that are taken by students who attend the university in the classroom setting.&lt;br /&gt;
It should be stated first that there shall be no procedure for retrieving surveys from online students. The university can pay other companies who already have such information. This procedure shall be for the administering of the survey in the classrooms of the universities.&lt;br /&gt;
The participants in the study will be seated in the classroom as the survey will be administered at the end of the class period. Teachers are suggested to end class 15 minutes earlier to manage the time it takes for participants to take the survey and for them to finish on time to leave class in an appropriate time. The survey can be administered when all of the class is ready, and will be administered to each student. The distribution method will not matter so the survey can be passed to each student in the front of the classroom, who will then pass the remaining tests backwards until each student has a copy of the survey. Before the survey is administered, the teacher who will administer the survey will brief the students. The briefing shall be as follows: “The University is considering the opening of an online classroom portion of the curriculum. Answer to the best of your ability. There is no right or wrong answer. If you have any questions, you may ask them now.”&lt;br /&gt;
As for controls, each class will administer the survey 15 minutes prior to the end of class. All will be quiet for the duration of the test and each teacher will administer the same brief to each class.&lt;br /&gt;
The method of delivery will be by paper.&lt;br /&gt;
Procedure&lt;br /&gt;
The participants of the study will take the survey by pen or pencil. Students will quietly take the test and then leave the survey on their desks face down as they leave. They will circle whichever item they associate with. The confidentiality of the test shall be protected by the collection of the test and then when research has been completed, will be shredded. During the time of research and collection, the information shall be stored into a locked cabinet. The keys of this document will be held by the researcher in charge. The information will be inputted into a computer. When each sheet of information is inputted, that paper will then be shredded. Those who are inputting the information into the computer are not aware of who the student is. The only identifiable feature of the student is the last four digits of his or her social security number.&lt;br /&gt;
When the students leave the teacher shall collect all the surveys and place them in the manila envelope provided with the packet of surveys. Then the teachers shall seal the envelope and then wait for retrieval by the research team. From there the surveys go straight to the processing of the information onto the computer or into the locked cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the use of both an in-house survey as well as the purchasing and use of surveys mined from other companies, the analysis process of this study would be a meta-analysis. Determining the type of response is dependent upon the data purchased from the learning platform development companies. The study should reveal what it is that the students are looking for in an online curriculum. If convenience is the desire for most students, what do those specific platforms utilize that enables the convenience for students?&lt;br /&gt;
The survey taken inside the classrooms of the university should have a significance level of at least a 3.5 on the average Likert score. The survey merely expresses the desire of the students who currently take classes in the traditional form if they wish to take classes online. This is a scale to justify the cost of the program development.&lt;br /&gt;
Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;
The university should consider first the students it currently serves. Should it consider an alternative to the traditional form of teaching? If so, is there a desire from the current students to take online courses? What specifically are the aspects of the other competing schools in the area of convenience for students? And, does the online platform the university offer the quality of service that students are looking for?&lt;br /&gt;
The future of the university may rest upon the forming of the curriculum of an online classroom setting. With the advent of many other colleges forming similar programs, it would be shortsighted to ignore the potentials to serve its current students as well as all future students for the curriculum of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This study seeks to find the relationship between social learning and self-efficacy upon individuals and its impact upon professional growth of the individuals. Using social learning and self-efficacy concepts proposed by Albert Bandura, the study done by Svenja Tams suggests a few things: First, “People’s ability to engage in self-directed learning has become increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings.” (Tams, 2008) According to Tams, this increased importance of self-directed learning occurs as a result of the “broadening” of work relationships and responsibilities. (Tams, 2008). Second, the implications for a manager are this: Experiential learning can be prohibitive in that it is sometimes “not feasible, or cumbersome and lengthy”. (Tams, 2008) That is, trial and error learning. Social learning however, involves the use of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions. (Tams, 2008) However, social learning is not the final answer for organizational management. According to Tams, self-directed social learning is largely dependent upon the individual. Depending upon the individuals differences of priorities, an initiative based seeking of mentorships, role models, and social group interventions is obviously, self-directed. Some individuals would probably not be interested in such an initiative.&lt;br /&gt;
Tams proposes that much has been written on the two ways in which an inidivudal develops skills related to the work force through “the ongoing engagement with their task and social environment.”. (Tams, 2008) In such a manner, Tams says, learning occurs in two ways. The first is experiential learning, or as mentioned above, trial and error leraning. According to Tams, this is “the ongoing reflection upon one’s actions and their outcomes.” (Tams, 2008) This thought process sometimes goes along as “was that a good decision or a bad decision?” The second way is the self-directed social learning way, which Tams elaborates upon in the study. (Tams, 2008)&lt;br /&gt;
Social learning is the theory formulated by Albert Bandura. This theory was made famous through the use of Bobo, a doll that was used in an experiment by Bandura. In this theory, children were made to watch a video of an adult acting violently towards the doll. Those children that watched the adult acting violently towards the doll were likely to exhibit the same traits to the same doll, when given the doll. Interestingly, when the video was watched with an adult in the room and when the adult made a disapproving comment towards the adult in the video acting violently towards Bobo, children were less likely to emulate that behavior. The disapproving or approving comments the adult made while watching the video were the positive or negative reinforcements of the behavior. Saul Mcleod says that according to Albert Bandura’s theory, people are “active information processors and think about the relationship between their behavior and its consequences” (Mcleod, 2016). This relationship between the environment and the learning process implies that the cognitive processes “are at work”. (Mcleod, 2016) This means that children don’t necessarily merely imitate behavior, but rather think about the behavior before emulating it.&lt;br /&gt;
Tam suggests that social learning behavior can be useful to the application of the organization related to business. This social learning can first, be predicted through a survey revealing a positive correlation of the traits of agreeableness and extraversion leading to high self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) This “inter-depedent self-construal” predicts social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008) Organizations are constantly training new employees. These employees can learn through trial and error or they can learn through social learning. Both methods have drawbacks however social learning theory can be an efficient model to training through the use of mentorship and role models. However, the obstacles to social learning are first examined through the relationship of the individual differences to social learning and therefore those with certain inclinations with personality and traits may be less susceptible to initiative based social learning in a work place environment. This can be a drawback for some of these employees as they are not involved in the initiative social learning process. However, Tam suggest that this behavior can be predicted based off of the variable traits of Costra and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” structure. (Tams, 2008) Then what of such traits? According to Tams, extroverts are more social: (Tams, 2008) “They can create more opportunities for social learning because they engage in more outgoing, gregarious, active, and excitement-seeking behaviors”. (Tams, 2008) These extroverts also “build inter-personal relationships more proactively and seek more feedback” Agreeable people also portray such positive experiences. For a manager, this is important information that Tams suggests managers be sensitive to. Tailoring the needs of the employee with the employees Big Five traits as well as the needs of the organization is likely to the benefit for the organization in that it employs productive employees on the basis of their learning ability.&lt;br /&gt;
The method of the study was by survey. 1,140 questionnaires were sent and 366 were returned. The average age of the respondents was 35 and held an average of 10 years of work experience. (Tams, 2008) There were five scales associated with the measurement of the respondent’s self-directed learning: relating to others, benchmarking, modeling, identifying with the organization, and distancing. The data involved extracting information from questions such as “How do you know that you can do a good job?”, and “Can you judge how well you can work this relationship [with a demanding client]?” These questions were measured on a five point scale from 0, “does not apply”, to 5, “used a great deal”. Then self-efficacy was measured through an 11 point scale, from 0, “cannot do it all”, to 10, “certain can do”. Then self-construal and pro-social dispositions was measured for agreeableness and extraversion, which was measured on a five point scale. Controls were included for gender, demographic differences, and industry sector. (Tams, 2008) The analysis “examined whether individual differences and sectors predicted the use of the five ways of self-directed social learning”, whereas the second part of the analysis involved mediating the differences between social learning and self-efficacy. (Tams, 2008)&lt;br /&gt;
The study finds that perhaps the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is not so clear. (Tams, 2008) Instead, the study finds that individual differences play a large factor in self-efficacy. More importantly, people with inter-depedent orientations, largely minorities from a collectivistic society, do not equate to success in a business organization. Tams suggests “ Even though contemporary management rhetoric aspires to relational competencies, work places are largely dominated by values that endorse an independent and assertive view of self in relations to others.” (Tams, 2008) This essentially means that the management style expressed now along the lines of “let’s work well together” is not exactly the most efficient. In fact, this work well together attitude is associated with low self-efficacy among certain employees, or for example, minority employees of collectivistic backgrounds. This means that sometimes it’s not always good to be agreeable. This sometimes can get in the way of self-directed social learning. Tams makes two points. First, inter-dependent people can sometimes “shifts attention to the external context” as a result of social cues demanding that these inter-dependent people point their attention to. (Tams, 2008) Second, a person with stable self-construal provides themselves with a “better understanding of the environment and develop their skillfulness in dealing with this environment.”&lt;br /&gt;
So the relationship between self-efficacy and social learning is complicated and the study reveals that the relationships between the two are entwined. Tams makes a few managerial implications. For those who are inter-dependent, some training could be offered so that they can build their confidence levels and assertion. For those with preference to social-learning that is self-directed, a variety of training can be directed to help focus their self-efficacy. A manager can take into consideration the variety of traits from Costa and McCrae’s “Big Five Personality” theories to prepare for potential problems associated with extroverted and agreeable traits. For example, Tams mentions the problem of a successful sales manager that begins to flounder when promoted to team leader. (Tams, 2008) Essentially, Tams’ conclusions are reached with his or her statement that “Organizations who seek to build on the diverse strengths of their people may consider creating roles and performance evaluation systems that are aligned with this orientation.” (Tams, 2008)&lt;br /&gt;
Self-efficacy is a desirable trait to have instilled in the employees of an organization for a variety of obvious reasons. Self-directed social learning is becoming “increasingly important in contemporary organizational settings”. (Tams, 2008) This changing scenery has resulted in broader responsibilities for the average employee. This self-directed learning is not just merely from the bottom up, but also the expectation now is that the responsibility for advancement falls upon the employee. (Tams, 2008) A company can present information in an organized training environment or can leave employees to learn the skills needed to thrive in an experiential learning method. The other potential method of learning is social learning. Tams suggests that social learning that is self-directed has “antecedents”. (Tams, 2008) Perhaps managers hold the hope that all employees are self-directed social learners. This would be an ideal situation for managers, since most of the managing would then be left to the employees to handle for themselves. However, the research suggests that such an idea, while perhaps ideal, must overcome certain obstacles. Cultural differences as well as Costa and McCrae’s Big Five Personality traits suggest that not all individuals are self-directed social learners. In fact, some traits of extroversion and agreeableness may keep individuals, for example, from making decisions that would perhaps make others feel uncomfortable. Tams quotes from the Talmud saying “we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are” to further make the point that even such self-directed social learning is based upon what the individual sees as certain social cues to encode or to model. Once again cultural differences or traits play an impact upon what type of social learning occurs. In this instance, inter-dependent self-construal is the framework upon which an individual views him or herself in relation to others. (Tams, 2008) Obviously collectivistic and individualistic societies shape the perspectives of individuals – each of these individuals respond differently to social learning and expectations on the job.&lt;br /&gt;
Social learning is a desirable trait to have in an employee. But not all employees have that self-directed social learning ability or are perhaps low in that ability. This may be the result of societal perspectives of individuals as well as personality traits. A manager, according to Tams, should be sensitive to these issues in the building of training models. As they say, no one size fits all. I personally agree with Tams. Social learning is a complex process and can be different in levels of achievement on the basis of social and character traits. Although my opinion has no particular basis in psychology, I believe that extroversion itself is not enough for success in a workplace environment, just as merely being high in agreeableness is also not enough for success. Perhaps it is the well-balanced approach that leads to effective work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my hypothetical situation, I will set up an environment that assists foreign immigrants in teaching them self-direct social learning. In this environment, the immigrants who are taking this class are to watch two adults who are engaged in a conversation. In this conversation, the adults will start with a small easy topic of conversation and eventually the conversation turns “sour” as one adult will begin to disagree with the other adult. This will convey to the immigrants watching the conversation the differences between inter-dependent self-construal and self-directed social learning. This type of scenario has to do with Albert Bandura’s social learning theory because the immigrant groups are watching two adults have a conversation. This conversation does not involve the immigrant group and the two adults having the conversation are “unaware” that they are being observed. This learning scenario is attempting to accomplish this: to teach immigrants American social cues as well as emphasis on individual preferences, even if it means to disagree with others.&lt;br /&gt;
This learning situation incorporates Albert Bandura’s Social Learning theory as well as takes a basis of application from Tams’ researching findings on self-directed social learning and inter-dependent self-construal. Cultural upbringing has much to do with these factors so I have decided to build a hypothetical learning situation in which I propose that social upbringing is learned from a variety of factors including social learning through observation. I propose that the same observational learning processes are involved in learning new cultural leaning such as higher extroversion and higher agreeableness. However, since Tams has proposed through his or her findings that extroversion and agreeableness are not necessarily conducive to effecting work habits, I propose this learning situation teaches a balanced approach to working together with others as well as the socially acceptable forms of disagreement in the face of external social cues like for example, a person visibly looking upset from a disagreeing perspective or point of view.&lt;br /&gt;
The methodology goes like this: No more than five participants will be involved in observing the two adults having a conversation. There will be one more participant in the group but he or she will not be a member learning new socially acceptable norms but rather will be the positive reinforcement to the five participants. As the participants watch the two adults having the conversation, the person that acts as a form of positive reinforcements will approve of the disagreement that the two adults have in the form of saying “wow, that person really handled that situation gracefully” and “that conversation really needed to happen” at the end of the conversation when the two adults part ways. The sample and participants will be a group of volunteers who are newly immigrated to the country or are working in this country on a temporary work visa. The design involves the participants watching the two adults have a conversation in a room and the participants will be watching behind a double sided glass mirror.&lt;br /&gt;
My hypothesis is that Costa and McMcrae’s Big Five Personalities can be altered to match a certain needed threshold. These individual participants will be asked to take a survey similar to Tams’ research survey. This survey will then be repeated after the end of the conversation being watched to see if the levels of agreeableness and extroversion change. My hypothesis concludes that such behavior is malleable and can change merely based upon the observational abilities of the participants.&lt;br /&gt;
I propose that the problems involved in this learning situation are that the surveys are the same between the participants before and after the observed conversation between the disagreeing adults. There may be bias in the survey if the participants assume that behavior was expected to change from before the observed learning and after. Secondly, it is assumed that these participants are able to speak a fluent level of English or a level fluent enough that the conversation is understood. Finally, does such a conversation have the ability to control for cultural bias and observer sensitivities? And is one observable conversation between the two adults enough for behavior to change immediately?&lt;br /&gt;
If behavior is easily changed upon the basis of one observed conversation, then companies may be very interested in sending their employees to such a seminar or training session in which employees learn to grow in a well-rounded manner. Companies looking to develop employees that are self-directed social learners may benefit from this greatly, but I propose that the greatest level of benefit comes from the managers, who then can spend less time training employees and more time facilitating opportunities for the employees to grow on their own, or in a self-directed social learning route.&lt;br /&gt;
Another two solutions exist here to the learning problem. The first is that employees can be trained to match the exact caricature of an employee that a company is seeking to develop. Companies can develop models of learning that teach employees through social learning to be more or less extroverted or more or less agreeable. Dependent upon the industry, a company can possibly mold employees to become more efficient in for example, salesmanship where agreeableness and extroversion can often be of benefit to the employee. Secondly, managers can also be developed and molded to fit a caricature of leadership that the company seeks to develop. So, less levels of agreeableness and less levels of extraversion can be beneficial to a leader or manager who often must make difficult situations in which not all parties may be pleased with the outcome. The opportunity to develop employees to fit the exact mold a company is looking for is obviously of interest to many people. And, if the problem can be solved quickly and efficiently, then the potential outcome and incremental gains can be massive for the company in general productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
A problem that could potentially occur as a result of the learning scenario is that not all people are high in the ability of social learning through observation. Speaking of cultural differences, there could be a group of employees who have different cultural backgrounds, perhaps one in which observational learning is not emphasized but rather verbal or auditory based learning. What then of a participant who lacks the ability to quickly pick up on social cues to be learned from the conversation of the two adults? Consider perhaps for example a man who is on a spectrum of autism like Asperger’s syndrome. Social cues often go unnoticed for these types of people so observational learning is not of benefit to these types of people. Which goes unsaid also for other types of learning disabilities or different styles of learning for other people – which of these people benefit least from observational learning?&lt;br /&gt;
The conclusion of the research paper and the hypothetical learning situation is this: self-directed social learning is an asset to companies that have employees with a broad range of job responsibilities. All of these responsibilities are learned one way or another, usually through corporate training or through simple trial and error. Dependent upon the company, the training that is already in place to teach workers the skills needed to thrive in the company may or may not be of effect in ratio of benefit to dollars. Furthermore, training through trial and error may eventually provide for an excellent employee, but this usually takes time and some errors may be costly. Additionally, what of an employee that burns out after an unspecified amount of time in the trial and error phase of learning? In an ideal world self-directed social learners inhabit the majority of the company and all of these employees are constantly learning from each other through observation. However, cultural and Big Five trait personalities inhibit that dream from happening. Tams suggests that these traits and cultural perspectives are antecedents to self-directed social learning. My proposal of the social learning theory in conjunction to Tams research findings was that the antecedents to self-directed social learning are attacked, molded and in a position to prepare future employees for a self-directed social learning world. Though even in such a hypothetical learning situation, there are still yet many more antecedents to this social learning but my hope is that these antecedents are also moldable. This is the hope that I have that people can learn from positive role models the best behavior and traits to make a person successful in the workplace and in the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Psychological tests can be fun. Those taking these tests can gain insights into an aspect of one’s personality that may have never been discovered if it were not for these tests. Or maybe the taking of a personality test can help you become more concrete on the personality traits you already have. It is the potential insight gained into a human being that makes a psychological test that much more important to humanity. But because of how important a test can be to someone, it is important to define and organize these tests into what they actually measure and how they are measured. These tests must also follow a guideline of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose and Importance of Test Criteria&lt;br /&gt;
Criteria are important because it gives both the test and test taker a defined set of expectations and outcomes. This is explained in each test manual as it gives the test administrator an understanding of the purpose of the test, how to administer the test, delivery of the test, interpretation of scores, and much more. These criteria are clearly explained in the manual and ambiguous words or phrases are discouraged from usage in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;
I have included examples from each of the manuals I intend to compare and contrast as well as giving a brief summary of each of the criterion of the tests. This also means that I have merged parts one and two of the exam together.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose/Description of the Measure&lt;br /&gt;
The stated purpose of the measure allows for the reader and test administrator to understand the meaning behind the test. The test specifies the domain and range of its stated purpose. Furthermore, it is important to know what the test is meaning to interpret. Questions on one test can be the same on another test, however those same questions may be used to measure a completely different issue. (Black, 1998) There can arise the issue of test bias if the test administrator is incorrectly administering the test based upon a faulty conclusion as to the purpose of the test.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Purpose/Description of the Measure&lt;br /&gt;
The National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam is an achievement test. It is designed to test the level of mastery related to the ability to “solve scientific and clinical problems”. (Guide to the Subject Examination Program, 2017) It also reflects “educational and development resulting from their overall medical school experiences.” (“Guide to the Subject Examination Program”, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
The Fagan Test of Infant intelligence measures the likelihood of mental retardation in infants, often quicker than having to wait years before parents can know if their child is developmentally mentally retarded. (Fagan, 2005)&lt;br /&gt;
The ETS Major Field Tests measure the amount of information learned and retained by students in any major field of study. (“About the ETS Major Field Tests”, 2018) This test helps universities meet accreditation standards as well as pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
All three of the manuals attempt to provide sufficient reasoning as to what the test is supposed to measure.&lt;br /&gt;
Author and/or Publisher&lt;br /&gt;
Understanding the author and publisher helps test takers to see any potential bias coming from the author and or publisher. With knowing the author and/or publisher, a test administrator can see further bodies of work of the test creator. And finally, the author and/or publisher can be contacted in there is any further question as to the administration of the test. As demonstrated below, not all tests are created by a single author. Often times the test can be created by an organization or a board of creators or auditors.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of the Author and/or Publisher&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program is written by the National Board of Medical Examiners. The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence is written by Joseph F. Fagan. The Major Fields Test is written by ETS.&lt;br /&gt;
Test Delivery Type&lt;br /&gt;
Test delivery types vary. Sometimes it is administered through the computer or it is administered through paper and pencil. All methods of delivery have pros and cons. Sometimes a computer administered test can be confusing to the examinee who is not familiar with computers. However, not all tests must be in paper or on a computer. Listed below is the Fagan Infant Intelligence test, which is delivered through a computer program, however the assessment is in the form of pictures and the reaction of the infant. Although there is often times a learning curve to understanding the computer delivery test format, this method has an advantage in that students can often times view the results of the test immediately. Understanding in clear detail the delivery type allows the test administrator to prepare the classroom or select the classroom most appropriate for the test taker.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of the Test Delivery Type&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program is delivered through a computer system that is web-based. It is proctored. The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence is self-administered with a portable viewing stage and a set of test pictures. The ETS Major Fields Test is administered through paper and pencil and the use of proctors.&lt;br /&gt;
Time Allocation/Limits for Testing&lt;br /&gt;
Too much time given to an examinee may defeat the purpose of the test however giving the student too little time allocation can take away from the validity of the test as the test does not give enough time for the examinee to thoroughly answer questions. It is important to include this in a test manual as the test procedure becomes standardized across all test takers. This assists the test results to provide consistent results. For example, the Fagan Infant Intelligence test is not specifically timed, but is rather given a roundabout amount of time usually taken to complete the test.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Time Allocation/Limits for Testing&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program’s time allocation is dependent upon what courses are being taken. These tests can take anywhere from 2 hours and 15 minutes all the way to 3 hours and 45 minutes. The Fagan Infant Intelligence Test usually allots 15 minutes of time and generally not more than 25 minutes. However, there is no time limit. The timing of the Major Fields Test requires 2 hours of testing time, unless the testing is for the MBA, which requires three hours.&lt;br /&gt;
Testing Environment&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the test environment there may be influences on the scores of the test. Some children do not do well in a foreign environment when taking a test for the first time. Also, depending on the location it may be distracting to the examinee and may also take away from the validity of the exam. The manual that provides information as to the testing environment often includes information such as seating arrangement, mood, and general conditions that provide the test taker with the ability to focus on the test with minimal distractions and inconsistencies as possible, such as cheating or being influenced by the other test takers.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of the Testing Environment&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program is administered in a setting in which the subject gains access to the test through a computer. The computer downloads a plug-in that prevents access to other materials and to detect any recording devices on the computer. The Fagan Infant Intelligence Test recommends a small office and that the space be “pleasant and home-like as possible” (Fagan, 2005) The Major Fields Test is administered in a classroom setting and proctors are required to walk about the room quietly to ensure there is no misconduct. (“Major Field Tests Test Administration Manual”, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
Verification of Examinee Identity&lt;br /&gt;
A test may not require verification of examinee identity if the examination is a form of self-assessment. However, for achievement examinations like the Subject Examination, it is necessary to validate identification so as to keep track of a progress of scores. For one, such assessments are usually used as entrance examinations for job or career prospects. Verification methods and accepted forms of ID may differ for each examination, so to ensure assessment consistency the manual includes information as to which IDs are accepted.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of the Verification of Examinee Identity&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination requires a valid form of ID that has both your signature and your photograph. Names must match exactly. The Fagan Infant Intelligence test does not require ID as infants usually do not have IDs.&lt;br /&gt;
Distribution To and Collection of Tests From Examinees&lt;br /&gt;
If there are multiple version of an exam that is distributed in paper form then test administrators should be mindful of the order of test distribution. Manuals can include distribution methods such as stacked seating arrangements in an auditorium setting or including information as to distribute tests to ensure that all tests are distributed are also returned to the administrator. Since the actual tests are not owned by the administrator but are used under permission, the tests must be returned back to the author and/or organization or disposed of in the requested setting.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of the Distribution To and Collection of Tests From Examinees&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program is administered online so collection and distribution is sent through a computer. The Fagan Infant Intelligence Test is administered through a CD and a series of pictures and is self-administered so the test is taken whenever the examinee’s parent feels ready to test. The Major Fields Test is presented in serial number order. This is to help ensure the tests you’ve received and distributed are also returned back to you in the same quantity. The collection must be administered in the same order it was distributed.&lt;br /&gt;
Testing Procedures for Examinees with Disabilities&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the disabilities and the assessment, manuals include information on how to appropriately deliver tests to accommodate for disabilities without influencing the test validity. Sometimes, the manual states that examination accommodations follow a specific protocol to follow.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Testing Procedures for Examinees with Disabilities&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program allows for oral rendering of a web examination. This oral rendering however must follow the NBME Protocol for Oral Rendering of Subject Examinations and this accommodation must be made the same day the test is ordered. (“Guide to the Subject Examination Program”, 2017) Also, those with visual impairments may use screen magnification software to help them access the test. The Fagan Infant Intelligence test allows for no accommodations for disabilities. The Major Fields test offers a “large type, Braille, or audiocassette edition” of each test. (“Major Field Tests Test Administration Manual”, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
Testing Procedures with Limited English Proficiency&lt;br /&gt;
Manuals stating accommodations for limited English proficiency may not relate to assessments involving academic achievement in an English speaking setting. Personality tests or overall intelligence tests have attempted to overcome this issue through the testing of patterns and shape recognition. (IPAT Culture Fair Intelligence Test, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Testing Procedures with Limited English Proficiency&lt;br /&gt;
None of these tests accommodate for limited English proficiency. Both the Subject Examination Program and the ETS Major Fields Test are assessments designed to test achievement in an academic setting that was originally taught in English. The Fagan Infant Intelligence Test does not accommodate for limited English Proficiency because infants do not yet speak. However, an accommodation or translation could be made for the administrators of the Fagan Infant Intelligence Test because these administrators are usually parents and not all parents speak English as a first language.&lt;br /&gt;
Test Security&lt;br /&gt;
When assessments are measuring achievement, a manual may request information to be locked prior to testing to prevent the sharing of information. Or, the information transmitted through a computer could be encrypted to prevent the identification of test examinees.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Test Security&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program’s security is based upon the computers use of the plug-in disabling the use of aids and the detection of recording devices used on the computer. The Fagan Infant Intelligence test does not use security methods. The Major Field Test requires students to be tested under the use of a proctor, seated in particular arrangement as to prevent cheating and the prohibition of any items except the test booklets, answer sheets, and the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
Reliability of Test and Generalizability of the Results&lt;br /&gt;
It may be necessary for the test administrator to measure results and to present that information to the test taker. In the case of the Fagan Infant Intelligence Test, reliability is explained in the purpose and description of the test.&lt;br /&gt;
Comparison of Reliability of Test and Generalizability of the Results&lt;br /&gt;
The Subject Examination Program scores based on a percentage of items answered correctly and is then compared to a reference group of previously took the test.&lt;br /&gt;
Recommend a Test Manual&lt;br /&gt;
Based on this data, I would recommend the Fagan Infant Intelligence test. This is based upon the lengthy summary and introduction of the test, its purpose, its background and its probability of success in detection of infants with disorders. I believe that furthermore, the ease of use of the test and its ability to properly instruct the test administrator was written effectively with the use of pictures and screenshots of the program that the test administrator, or parent was to use in the diagnosis process. This is also supplemented with a VHS training video that also further helps the parent and test administrator to administer the test effectively. Not only does the Fagan Infant Intelligence test provide ample reasons as to the effectiveness of the overall test, the Fagan Infant Intelligence test also provides for the explanation of the scores. Obviously this is necessary in a self-administered test but the manual is written clearly in a way that helps the parent to make a proper diagnosis. Furthermore, more dialogue is given on some of the common points of potential confusion a parent may have such as that their baby “doesn’t (or didn’t) seem to be looking at the pictures.” (Fagan, 2005)&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I choose the Fagan Infant Intelligence manual because the manual attempts to address the issues commonly found with parents as well as attempting to address the use of the program. The manual not only involves the manual itself but also includes a training VHS. The purpose and summary is thoroughly written with citations of the effectiveness of the test.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PSY221 Psychology Final Project (On David Rockefeller's wealth; did his past influence his future?)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy221-psychology/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/psy221-psychology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What would your adult life look like when you grow up roller-skating down Fifth Avenue while your limousine drives behind you in case you get tired? What if your grandfather was in fact, the richest man in modern history? What kind of an adult would you turn out to be? Does being born into wealth turn you into a snob? Or does merely being born into the American elite only have to do with your last name? And if you never need to worry about food, clothing, or where to work, and merely having the prestige of one of the most famous last names in the entire world, are you more likely to be self-actualized?&lt;br /&gt;
David Rockefeller’s achievements, legacy, and personality are the result of his need for achievement along the same lines as his grandfather, his social upbringing, and his ability to have the majority of his needs met through the hierarchy of needs, thereby becoming self-actualized more often and consistently than those who are not in a position of prestige.&lt;br /&gt;
The three theories to be used as a hypothesis of David Rockefeller are as follows: Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, achievement motivation theory, and Allport’s trait theory.&lt;br /&gt;
There are limitations, however, to this analysis. One, the former David Rockefeller is no longer here to take an Allport personality test, so we are limited in his analysis to the observations we can make from him and from others who knew him personally. Second limitation is researcher bias. I do not like David Rockefeller so I must be careful to be as objective as possible in my analysis. I do not believe there is an ethical concern to this case study because one, I draw from David Rockefeller’s personal memoirs, and two, I’m using secondary sources so whatever ethical concern one may have can rest assured be comforted knowing that the damage has already been done, and that at this point here in this research we are merely observing the remains of the capsized ship.&lt;br /&gt;
David Rockefeller was born the youngest of six children. He grew up, went to college at Harvard, and went to get his doctorates at the University of Chicago. He was married in 1940. After a brief affair with politics he then enlisted as a private, serving abroad in Africa before being honorably discharged as a captain. (David Rockefeller, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
David Rockefeller was put to work for Chase bank and then went on to oversee the merging of the Manhattan bank – we now know this bank as the Chase Manhattan bank. During and after this period David Rockefeller spent his time for various charity groups and serving on the board for the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother created. (David Rockefeller, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
His notable achievements are the founding of the Trilateral Commission and the attending of the Bilderberg meetings as well as becoming a director on the Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;br /&gt;
In his personal family life, David Rockefeller remembered his father as “distant” and “formal, but not cold” (Rockefeller, 2017) He remembers his own father having had a “nervous collapse” and that he remembers his Grandfather as “possibly the richest man in America” and according to David’s own words, “one of the most hated”. (Rockefeller, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
The existential-humanistic theory was based on the concept of phenomenology. And the men who founded this school of thought were Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Carl Rogers started the train of thought that the relationship of the therapist was helping the individual self-discover the healing process, leading eventually to improved self-esteem. High self-esteem has many positive social benefits: individual happiness (Shackelford, 2001), academic achievement (Schmidt &amp;amp; Padilla, 2003), and supportive social behavior (Schimel, Arndt, Banko, &amp;amp; Cook, 2004). (Chopra, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
The socio-emotional development theory of development proposes that the child’s future cognitive ability is based on the idea that “The core features of emotional development include the ability to identify and understand one’s own feelings, to accurately read and comprehend emotional states in others, to manage strong emotions and their expression in a constructive manner, to regulate one’s own behavior, to develop empathy for others, and to establish and maintain relationships.” (Social-Emotional Development Domain, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
The father of the sociocultural approach was Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky. The core approaches to this perspective was based upon the idea that children learn from their parents and culture and that language had much to do with the upbringing of the child. The language being important is that psychologists have noted that children speak to themselves while they act, supposing that the act of speaking is a memory recall technique that a child will later utilize in life. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017) The Robber’s Cave is an example of how two different groups of cultures can be taught to be antagonistic towards another group. (Sociocultural Approach, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
Childhood was for David Rockefeller, “a child’s paradise.” (Rockefeller, 2008) David Rockefeller grew up with no needs for food or water. There was even an infirmary in one of the floors of his father’s estate, then the biggest private estate in New York. David Rockefeller roller skated through the streets of New York with a limousine following closely behind to pick up him and his other siblings on the chance that they get tired. David Rockefeller was by all means, taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;
It was when David Rockefeller graduated from the University of Chicago with his Ph.D. that he set off on his own, becoming a junior politician to an Army Captain during the Africa campaigns of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;
Here you can see his upbringing as to how David Rockefeller could have been so successful, passionate, and with such achievement due to his upbringing. Many people go through life at the lower parts of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Some people who are exponentially less fortunate than David struggle to eat every day before they attempt to meet the success they search for, whether it is college or financial success.&lt;br /&gt;
With David Rockefeller’s rolodex of 150,000 names of powerful people, (Kandell, 2017) it could be said that the hierarchy of Abraham Maslow was meet up and down the tiers consistently and without failure. He was adored by the majority of his peers and led a life of a successful political career as well as an international figure.&lt;br /&gt;
It was no far stretch to assume then that such success brought forth more success, and was the reasoning for his longevity as well as his tireless efforts into the philanthropy and art collection he assumed well into his 90’s. (Kandell, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
David Rockefeller refers to the public’s term to his grandfather; that is, “Robber Baron” (Rockefeller, 2008) so it can be assumed that David Rockefeller had some sense of the distrust that the public had for the Rockefeller family. It was probably the reason why the family had distanced itself from the public, seeking rather seclusion instead of infamy. When Diego Rivera was commissioned to paint the mural for the Rockefeller Center, there must have been some sort of miscommunication. David Rockefeller, upon seeing the final painting, had it destroyed. (Wallenburg, 2017) David Rockefeller sensed that there was some sense of disrespect the painter had implied with the mural. There was, according to Rockefeller, “Unfortunately, what [Rivera] painted was different from the sketch. The picture of Lenin was on the right-hand side, and on the left, a picture of [my] father drinking martinis with a harlot and various other things that were unflattering to the family and clearly inappropriate to have as the center of Rockefeller Center.” (Wallenburg, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
This is probably not the first time David Rockefeller felt his family or he himself was persecuted by the mob of the public. In this very environment David and his siblings were raised as a family. His culture within his family, though very much affected by American culture at large, the looming culture overall was that of a unique culture. That is, the Rockefeller culture. How many other American families come from what is considered aristocracy? Very few.&lt;br /&gt;
His early schooling was at the Lincoln School in Manhattan, where children from all social backgrounds came together for an education. Seeing children less privileged as he must have impacted him greatly, as his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago was based upon the Great Depression and the effects of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal intervention into the American economy was helpful to the economy. (Kandell, 2017) His wife was also dedicated to the causes larger than herself, who was “a dedicated conservationist”. (Kandell, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
Combined with socio-emotional, socio-cultural, and existential humanistic perspectives of psychology, we can see how David Rockefeller became the man who was involved in such large organizations such as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the investment of international banking policies through the Chase Manhattan bank. David Rockefeller was raised to wield the family wealth was respect and dignity. Kandell finds an interesting quote by David Rockefeller: ““I have never found it a hindrance,” he once said with typical reserve. “Obviously, there are times when I’m aware that I’m treated differently. There’s no question that having financial resources, which, thanks to my parents, I learned to use with some restraint and discretion, is a big advantage.” (Kandell, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, Kandell also writes:” With his powerful name and his zeal for foreign travel — he was still going to Europe into his late 90s — Mr. Rockefeller was a formidable marketing force. In the 1970s, his meetings with Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai of China helped Chase Manhattan become the first American bank with operations in those countries. “Few people in this country have met as many leaders as I have,” he said.” (Kandell, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
There are a few biases in this study that bear mentioning. First is that there is a gigantic negative societal view of David Rockefeller by those who know more than a few events past the fact that David Rockefeller comes from a distinguished family. This limitation makes it difficult to find research that does not have a bias against David Rockefeller. On the other hand, there are many articles that are in praise of David Rockefeller, despite his failings as the head of the Chase Manhattan bank and its profits from the bailout of New York City’s financial crisis in the 1970’s (Wallenburg, 2017), the questionable organizations he was a part of such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as the suppression of art that depicted any sort of negative view on his family as exemplified from the Diego Rivera incident. Actually it seemed to be more difficult to find neutral topics on David Rockefeller as most people who are “neutral” about him know very little about his accomplishments or achievements.&lt;br /&gt;
Second bias would be historical bias. So far the implications of his actions have not been favorable to David Rockefeller. For example, his urging of Jimmy Carter to admit the Shah of Iran for cancer treatment was blamed on David Rockefeller for the instigation of the Iran hostage affair in the American embassy. His grandfather was accused of equipping the National Guard with weapons to put down a miner’s strike at a facility in Colorado, named the Ludlow Massacre, where two dozen people were killed. Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefeller’s brother, oversaw the oppression of the Attica prison uprising which killed 39 people. These events certainly do not help the image problem that the Rockefellers struggle with so the historical bias against the Rockefeller’s was at least tried by the researcher, to be accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the bias would be the researcher bias. Through this research I have found that I have a more thorough understanding of David Rockefeller as a human being. He wasn’t a monster depicted by other people. Nor was he a saint. David Rockefeller is an example of a man whom with good intentions made mistakes that caused the suffering of other people. This is typical of all cases of men who are gifted into such extraordinary circumstances that the burden of responsibility to somehow “give it back” lies heavily upon them. I feel that the weight of David Rockefeller’s shoulders were heavy. And yet, though he tried so hard to help others who were less fortunate than him, he was still divided by such a large gap that he would never be able to understand what it would be like to be less fortunate than he was. His upbringing was an exceptional case and there are not many people who can share the experience of growing up like how David Rockefeller grew up.&lt;br /&gt;
As a result of that, I tried my best to first look at the source material. I read through the work of David Rockefeller’s memoirs and have tried my best to see life through his eyes. I found that incredibly and yet unsurprisingly, he is just a human being. I’ve heard it said that David Rockefeller was a monster, a psychopathic tyrant. He is not. He is however, a human being that was born into a particular set of circumstances. He was most certainly not worthy of the praise of all men, however.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m glad that I researched David Rockefeller. I feel I understand him more. It must have been difficult to live with such a sense of responsibility placed upon him at such a young age. But he like all other humans will need to have their works tested by the fire to be seen if the work created is left standing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ENG204 Interdisciplinary Reading and Writing Final Project (The role of the manager in the light of human action and the age of information. Not happy with this paper.)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those in business management must factor in the element of human action when structuring change in policies or organization in the business. In order to understand the impact of human action upon those in the business management world, it is first important to define what a manager is. According to Mises, a manager is “a junior partner of the entrepreneur, as it were, no matter what the contractual and financial terms of his employment are.” (Mises, 2009) Mises makes a strong distinction between the entrepreneur and the manager. Here in “Human Action”, entrepreneurs predict future market trends by allocating capital towards those market trends in the hopes of profit. The entrepreneur, according to Mises, controls the factors of production. (Mises, 2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Then, what factor does the role of human action play in the day to day decisions of a business manager? It is the desire of human consumption through wants and needs that are the driving forces of what keeps both the entrepreneur alive and thereby pays the manager a salary. It is the action of humans that drives forward business to new heights. It is assumed that business assessments to which managers and entrepreneurs make decisions are based upon facts and only facts – however that does not sufficiently explain the hysteria of a boom-bust cycle of a business and why people tend to buy emotionally and afterwards to justify their decisions based upon so called logical factors. (Lesly, 1965) If then human action impacts business cycles and stock market prices, consider office politics and other related forms of human interaction that cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers and facts. How can you factor in the variable of a man or woman who is having an affair with another colleague? These variables are all considerations that are based upon human action. And human action cannot necessarily be quantified in terms of numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Then can human action be predictable for business managers? Most certainly. That is why businesses evolve policies and guidelines to hedge against unknown variables such as sexual harassment problems within the workplace as well as business cycles. However, the solution becomes a problem when companies religiously believe that it is the mere policies and guidelines of a company that can prevent the behavior completely or to change the behavior of a person completely or the belief that if a company just has enough data that it would therefore be able to make perfect decisions. It is the same mistaken assumption in creating a product for the market in which consumers have no interest in. You cannot mold the desire of the market but rather the manager and entrepreneur must conform to it.&lt;br /&gt;
There appears to be a trend towards computerizing human desire as well as market trends. (Lesly, 1965) That is, the belief that human desire and action can be quantified and classified. But this is true only to a certain extent. Man has long known that there are basic desires of humanity that will never change and will always remain. Food, sex, shelter, respect for peers, and so on along the Maslow hierarchy of needs. But it is the manifestation of those desires into human action that is unpredictable and unclassifiable. Who knew that during the 1950’s so many products and gadgets would have come to fruition eventually coining the design term “Populuxe” — that products would be a manifestation of a philosophy and outlook upon life? If man’s needs were basic and man only bought products to satisfy those needs, then a man would not purchase a V8 400 horsepower car but rather would just purchase a car with specifications just enough to allow for him to grow into a family, should he so desire. Instead though, man has shown through the purchase of products and the decisions of his actions that he chooses products based on, yes, a desire to fulfill a basic need but the actions of his fulfillment of his needs are much more complicated than a manager would want to admit.&lt;br /&gt;
Marketing and advertising has long pined after the holy grail of prophecy of human action. But the best marketers and advertisers can only test the market. And from there they can only improve the product to best fit the needs of the market. It is possibly, from the author’s speculation, the reason behind the mass computerization of human action into data. But although the brain has patterns of commonality with the computer, it is not a computer. Human action may be based upon logic, but it seems rather a justification of emotional purchases or decisions. This is not to say that humans are irrational beings. It is the whole work of Mises and the Austrian School of Economics that defines human action as praxeology, or, the study of purposeful human action. It is the mass of purposeful human action by people that creates market demand and destroys it. And it is the mass of purposeful human action that dictates the productivity of the work environment of a business.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesly is quoted,&lt;br /&gt;
“Carried to an extreme, efforts to computerize business judgements, in a world run by human attitudes, create their own defeats. They squeeze out the unique and the original, because things or ideas that have not existed before tend to be “vague” and cannot be measured. They solidify the positions of organization men and smother ideas from the outside. They reward the superficial because it can be measured. Albert Einstein, who is usually considered this century’s epitome of the precise computer-like mind, said in “Out of My Later Years”: “Perfect of means and confusion of goals seem—in my opinion—to characterize our age.” (Lesly, 1965)&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially, the rush behind the computerizing of data was an attempt to hedge risk for the entrepreneur, and to make the life of a manager easier. And the fruit of computerizing data was hugely successful, there should be no doubt. The ancients and even those who lived in the world of business just 30 years prior would have longed for the technology we possess now in our hands. Before the advent of cheap data allocation and storage, business leaders had adopted whatever tools and technologies available to maximize efficiency and profits and to make better decisions in the face of incomplete information and the general fog of war that comes with making decisions and creating policies. From the Renaissance’s Girolamo Cardano to game theory’s John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, the idea behind such “unpredictable” factors went from the concept of mere probability to quantifying of the so called random actions of people in “which deals in situations where people’s decisions are influenced by the unknowable decisions of “live variables” (aka other people)” (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
Neither can business-based management thrive on a mythical or spiritual concept of human action based decisions. There are many business leaders who rely on mere “gut instinct”, which to some explains largely the success of gut based leaders like George Soros and Jack Welch. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Harvard Business Review is correct. The brain/gut dichotomy is false. (Buchanan, O’Connell, 2017) Business managers cannot thrive on just one form of decision making. But this common fallacy of the dichotomy of brain and gut exists as a result of the current inability to mediate between the two regions of the “styles” of leadership and decision making.&lt;br /&gt;
It appears that the human action element also plays a consistent role in the perception of management as well. How can you quantify a manager who does not appear to be sure of himself or herself and therefore becoming uninspiring of confidence? Ejimabo goes so far as to defining the terms of leadership and decision making—of the many different ideas of the concept of leadership and decision making it seems clear the general idea of leadership and decision making universally accepted but one definition of the term of leadership seemed appropriate for the topic here. “Leadership is a process of giving purpose (meaningful direction) to collective effort, and causing willing effort to be expended to achieve purpose” (Ejimabo, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, Ejimabo’s study of the influence of decision making and business management finds that the business manager must somehow find a place for humanity in the light of all the information that is processed daily. What sort of relationship does the manager hold with his or her team? And what sort of relationship does the manager hold with the entrepreneur? Does the manager listen effectively? All of the basic elements of the respect of the human being appear to lead teams to prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;
McCaffrey suggest that Sun Tzu’s Art of War is rooted in economic thought (McCaffrey, 2014) – and the most important concept of Art of War is that you must know your enemy. This concept can be drawn from both knowing the competition as well as the market and as well as knowing who those are that you are leading. Obviously the information drawn from the battlefield of economic warfare and from human resources is important but to view these forces as mere cause and effect is to be reactionary, not revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, in the business world this guiding of purposeful action through effective listening and relationship building is known as mere communication but it is much more than that. The communication is just the medium through which one human being navigates through others. If the communication is the ship then purposeful human action is the wind, the sea, the sun, and the moon—the raw form of nature that holds the ship at her mercy.&lt;br /&gt;
So then business managers who manage ideally and effectively are ones who lead with purposeful direction. Once again we return to the impact of purposeful human action in the realm of business and management. Business managers must fully comprehend the importance and impact that purposeful human action has on decision making and policies. And it is from this perspective that managers must make decisions, as well as factoring in computerized data and the “gut” feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
This is quite the challenge in the face of modern business. Transactions are now processed in mere seconds and information is relayed even quicker. Now a decision made in London can be processed in New York City within a blink of an eye. And now due to the globalization of business, managers now encounter new challenges such as working with persons of different cultures as well as the confounding issue of ethics and morals in an ever changing world. The concepts that business leaders relied upon a mere five years ago may no longer be relevant in the new information age. And how can a manager plan for problems that are unrelated to the business? For instance, a laborer under a manager that marries a coworker or an employee that is contributing to a “hostile work environment”? How shall a manager account for human resource biases in the hiring of new employees? Should human resources hire for diversity over raw skills and talents?&lt;br /&gt;
The problem then is what a manager can do in the light of all the new information that piles up on a manager’s desk. What information is worth the precious time to evaluate? And how can the manager make even quicker decisions in the face of all of the information that is passed onto him or her? Once again I propose filtering of that information in terms of what the information reveals in purposeful human action. It is the purposeful human action that drives or kills a market or a business and it is the basis of human action that leads a company to either success or to failure. Leaders, as Ejimabo states, are those who can influence others into purposeful human action, and such a skill requires the understanding that humans to be lead are first to be recognized as human beings who each have their own interests in life. A manager for example is motivated to increase profits for the company because the entrepreneur will then instead find another manager who can do the job more successfully.&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize then, what are the main points of this essay? First, it is that humans are not necessarily irrational creatures. Proof of this is in the modern hysteria in the attempt to collect all information possible to predict future behavior. Human behavior can be predicted – but only in the sense that needs of humans are consistent, and that these needs are acted out in purposeful behavior. How that behavior is manifested is dependent upon the individual.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, it is that humans are not irrational creatures because of the basis of purposeful human action. This purposeful action is what drives all of the forces of the market as well as the interactions between manager and laborer and entrepreneur. This purposeful human action accounts for the problems and solutions of the business world. How shall an organization move forward with office politics or with the problem of innovation?&lt;br /&gt;
These problems arise as a result of humans seeking what is in their best interest, or to the highest purpose of their actions. Obviously a vacuum of direction exists within the realm of office politics which gives way for laborers to seek out interests not in the best interest of the business. What of the problem of slowing innovation and creativity? There are many causes to this but it boils down to the lack of initiative taken by managers and laborers because of a lack of a variety of different motivators. These people have found it more purposeful to stay in the shadows and to “stay quiet”.&lt;br /&gt;
Third, it is the responsibility of the manager, within the context of the junior associate of the entrepreneur, to work within his or her means to produce profits by the guiding of the purposeful human action into productivity. This means the shaping of specific policies that are grounded in the reality that is purposeful human action. Policies that are shaped in the back rooms of a management only office cannot account for all of the different variables that come into play in the business world.&lt;br /&gt;
This is why a solid steering of direction must be set into place and obstacles overcome with the filtering of information through the eyes of purposeful human action. A sheltered company with sheltered managers who are blindly shaping policy and procedures will not survive in the long term and especially in the inevitable bust cycle of business. Managers must constantly be aware of the human action factor that plays a role in all of the movements of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
EDU445&lt;br /&gt;
Determine Your Role in the Advocacy Effort&lt;br /&gt;
The advocacy role I have determined to use in this approach is the self-advocacy approach. Specifically, self-advocacy refers to those with specific needs needing to be advocated for to have that done for themselves rather than through the representation of others. I have chosen this form of advocacy because I chose not to represent any group nor affiliate myself with a group. Therefore, this form of advocacy on behalf of changing minimum state standards for early child hood educators is based on my own experience. My plan for self-advocacy is the utilization of a key stakeholder – the parents, therefore being able to make decisions and make actions on my own basis rather than through an organization or agency will allow me to work with parents quickly and efficiently so that I can push my advocacy forward.&lt;br /&gt;
Another advantage to self-advocacy is that it takes less effort to organize. Since I am an advocate to myself on behalf of a cause I feel strongly about, I only need to organize myself instead of the various other people I might have to coordinate with in order to represent them. This simplifies logistics for me. Though there is a benefit to being financially supported through mutual groups, I still reject citizen advocacy because of the organizational factor. I want to present myself as an unbiased individual. When I am representing groups or agencies I can potentially be seen as an individual with vested interest and benefits I would gain from representing other agencies. When I act as a self-advocate, I can present myself as an individual with reasonable conclusions based on research and experience that I have gained personally. I believe in some ways this makes me more trustworthy since I have a face and a name that I can be held accountable to.&lt;br /&gt;
The three resources I will utilize as I begin my advocacy efforts are writing blog posts, learning to work with media and the media, and building relationships with political candidates. I can find the first two on websites such as WordPress, as well as the local newspaper where I can submit an opinion piece concerning my subject matter. Finally, I can also utilize the internet to get a hold of my local representatives and reach out to them through the use of the internet or a physical letter. Furthermore, when I have created a blog, I now have access to millions of other blogs. Within these numerous blogs, I can identify those that would be interested in my position of advocacy. I am not the first educator to start a blog, and when I have one, I can make comments and exchange ideas with other educators. I am beginning this advocacy of increased childcare educator standards because I have come to this conclusion through research and experience. So, I can exchange that information with other educators and stakeholders – perhaps they will come to the same conclusion as I will and I can be further encouraged to advocacy, or perhaps the will modify or reach another conclusion with the information I’ve shared and I can modify my advocacy to better fit the good for stakeholders. When I have a newspaper, I can utilize the resource of credibility. While blogs are very easy to begin and self-publish, still in the minds of the general population a newspaper holds higher credentials. I can send my opinions to these newspaper agencies and perhaps one of them will publish my opinion. This is an advantage to me because I can point readers to my blog while at the same time presenting my information on a credible platform. When I need to reach out to policy makers, I can utilize Twitter because if my information is accurate and concise, policy makers can usually respond back within the same day, if not within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Identify the Stakeholders of This Macro-Level Advocacy Effort&lt;br /&gt;
Because I am working by myself and am developing advocacy through self-advocacy, I have selected two stakeholders through which to disseminate my advocacy. The first stakeholder will be the general population. I am looking to change minimum state requirements so I must first attempt to discuss my issue with the general population, which can later leverage my position to policy makers. I would start by creating a blog in which I advocate my cause. Because a blog is easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, I don’t have to go through a publisher such as a newspaper and hope to be published. With the general public I can write my blog as if I am a concerned citizen with a credentialed background in education. I can present my case as it relates to society as a whole and what raising the minimum standard can do as it would directly benefit the public with more well-behaved children as a result of higher education of educators. When I write my blog, I write in plain English. I am not speaking to credentialed educators. I am speaking to a general population of people so I speak plainly. The content of the information when I write to the general population would be slanted so that I can focus on impact of cost that low or minimal standards for educators would be for the average tax payer. I would also focus on the potential for job growth for local market involved in the credentialing process of newer and stricter standards for childhood educators.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, another stakeholder would be other educators. Again, on my blog I can again to my educators that I am an advocate that is in the field of which he is advocating. I am not just a distant person that is disconnected from the industry. Utilizing this blog, I can establish my credentials as well as using my credentials to advocate for my cause. When I write, I remind my readers and potential stakeholders, educators, that I have an informed opinion because I am a school administrator. To educators as stakeholders, I remind them that I am witnessing first hand accounts of the troubles related to minimal state standards for childhood educators. I could for example speak on how ill-prepared newly minted educators are when they arrive into the schooling environment and how this disrupts the learning environment because educators become stressed with adjusting to a reality to which their education did not prepare them for.&lt;br /&gt;
Third, I will also identify policy makers as another stakeholder. I am attempting to change state requirements. I am unable to do this unless I run for office. Therefore, I can instead reach out to my local, state, and federal policy makers in order to ask them to consider the change in state requirements. I can do this easily through the use of Twitter. Twitter allows my comments to reach inside their pockets. Because most policy makers have phones to access Twitter or give their staff members access to their official Twitter account, I can directly communicate with them. My approach with policy makers will be that of an advisor. I do not want to lobby so I will not make a request for action. However, being in a position of advisor holds benefits, so I can utilize the Twitter platform to directly hand off key information for policy makers that supports my view.&lt;br /&gt;
And fourthly, I will identify parents as another key stakeholder. Parents are the ones that drop their children off to childcare centers as well as being the primary financial sponsors of children in being able to pay for the educational tuition. Therefore, parents ought to have a very invested interest in raising the educational standards of early childhood educators. For parents, I will explain to them that the biggest advantage to having a higher standard would be that parents can trust the educators that receive these credentials. Parents likely have a harder time as general lay people deciding which teacher would be the best for their child. If there could be some form of a credentialed service for parents that they can trust as a general source of authoritative information, they would be able to rest assured that the educators receiving these credentials would be trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;
Although advocacy and lobbying have similar agendas, it is the action part of lobbying or advocacy that separates the two forms. Advocacy involves the sharing and spreading of knowledge and information of which you are either for or against. Lobbying involves advocacy plus the usage of requesting a political official to move in action for or against a topic of discussion. When I as an educator am requesting that a policy maker vote for or against a subject, I am directly lobbying. However, when I am educating or informing a policy maker on the topic that I am advocating, this stands as advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;
My blog posts and newspaper opinion submissions are not requesting any call to action, only merely demonstrating the benefits of changing the minimum standards of early childhood educators. Furthermore, when I am reaching out to policy makers through Twitter, I do not make any call to action and I do my best to remain ignorant of upcoming bills and laws. But it is still helpful to include policymakers in the advocacy process because of their larger platform. I do not have to present a call to action to these people. Just the fact that their platform caters to hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions of people gives me an advantage in being able to include them into the advocacy process. Furthermore, they hold an authoritative position in policy. Being able to include a policy maker in my advocacy further increases the credibility of my stance.&lt;br /&gt;
Identify One Stakeholder to Collaborate With, and Create a Plan for Collaboration&lt;br /&gt;
The stakeholder I have identified with for further collaboration would be parents. I do not use the general population, educators, nor policy makers for collaboration for the following reasons. I am able to see the parents every day. This makes them ideal candidates for collaboration. Educators have their own agenda to follow and often times in order to collaborate with them I may have to go through an agency or a group. The general population only exists as an abstract concept and would be difficult for me to meet with the general population to advise and inform them on my advocacy stance. Finally, policy makers are distant and I am likely unable to meet with these people for very cheap. Because I want to keep my platform cost efficient, I do not utilize policy makers for collaboration. Educators may be interested in collaboration, but perhaps they would have vested interest in keeping the standards low so that they can afford cheaper labor overall for their businesses, if they operate as a business owner. This would mean that they would either not be very interested at all in collaborating with my advocacy or that they would be against it completely.&lt;br /&gt;
Parents are naturally involved in stakeholder engagement. They bring their children into class and are invested in seeing their children grow and develop to the best of their abilities. Therefore, as an educator I have a shared purpose, vision, and buy-in with the parents. With a policy maker my shared purpose may be similar with him or her but the buy-in may be different. With trust and a sense of interdependence, I would have to develop that over a long period of time. With parents I have already begun the establishment of the trust and interdependence. With parents, the indicators of progress however may be different. Parents may want to see their children to grow up well but may be completely uninterested in policy changes. They may have the “good enough is good enough” attitude concerning revised standards for early childhood educators. However, with a policymaker I could potentially have similar indicators of progress with him or her. If my intention was to change policy, then the policy maker would also look at policy changes as a key indicator that change is happening and that what he or she wants is coming to fruition.&lt;br /&gt;
My strategy would be first to introduce personally to the parents the need for a greater educational requirement for educators when they enroll their child or children into my school. I would explain to them the difference between my own colleagues and that of other educators at other schools. I would begin by explaining to them that it is relatively easy to be employed at a child care facility and that the requirements are very lax. When parents begin to see the difference between my child care center and that of my competitors, I can move to my second phase – I would then ask parents to visit the other child care centers and ask if the educators at that facility are credentialed. Likely the answer at the other facility will be that of confusion because there is no credentialing process for a person to be employed and teach at a child care center. My child care center would stand out from others because I would explain to these parents that my educators have credentials beyond that of the basic continuing education that is mandatory for each state. I would explain that these courses are chosen by the educators beyond what is mandatory for the state because the educators at my facility have an excellence approach to continuing education. From here I would lament that this process is not standard for all child care facilities to the parents. I would explain to the parents that I have a blog started in which I am advocating for further standards for child care educators and that I am in currently in the process of speaking with policy makers as well as submitting opinion articles to newspapers. I would then encourage the parents to also speak with others and policy makers about the need for higher standards for child care educators. They have already begun this process if they, after having interviewed my child care facility and have gone to another facility asking about further “credentials”. Though of course the other facility would explain that no, there are no specific credentials for their educators that there is a basic continuing education law that their teachers follow. From there, I would then contact policy makers and mention that parents have been asking for increased standards for early childhood educators. I would mention to the policy makers that the standards are influencing negative affects and that parents, their constituents, are developing a growing concern for such increased standards on a statewide level. There would be no direct form of lobbying because there may be no active vote for or against my advocacy stance and second, so far I have only identified the need for raising standards, not exactly what those increased standards should be on a statewide level of certification.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Educate the Preschool Teachers on Professional Goal Setting&lt;br /&gt;
Educators,&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever thought to sit and count the amount of thoughts that go through your mind in a single day? How about in a single hour? Let’s try counting for just one minute. Of all the thoughts that come in one ear and out the other, which of those thoughts is relevant to you now? And which is relevant to you later? There is a saying that, if you do not make your own plans for life that you will become someone else’s plan. Setting goals in your life allows you to become the main character in your novel or movie. Setting goals is what brings you from a background character into the main star. Furthermore, you are in a position to influence. As educators we may have read and studied how important it is to set goals but we may ourselves set goals too low for ourselves or not set any goals at all. How then can you expect your students also to achieve something great in their lives if you yourselves have no goals? Does the apple not fall far from the tree?&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from your professional obligation to be the best you can be so that you can encourage your students to do the same, there are other tangible benefits to setting long term goals. First, setting goals reduces burnout and increases your ability to teach. (Bright Hub Education, 2010) Teaching is a skill that is developed over a long period of time. (2010) You will need to make adjustments in the various tools of your skill-set and going from an abstract thought in your mind into a verifiable and quantifiable statement or fact written on paper will turn fantasy into reality. Perhaps you have a friend that’s told you numerous times his or her idea for a book. Has that person ever started writing that idea down? If not, I encourage you to tell that person to “get real”. You as educators also can “get real” with your expectations and desires by setting long term goals. Not only does setting long term goals help you with the development of your skill, it also helps with morale. (2010) Learning to teach is a lifelong process and setting goals helps you all to remind yourselves where you came from and where you are going. From experience I have enjoyed looking back at some of my past goals and felt slightly embarrassed at how unrealistic and unrelated that goal was to my life now in the present. This indicates that I was veering to the side here and there. This is a normal process in life and again, the goal setting process keeps you from really getting off track. I’ll introduce to you a basic concept that we can use as a guideline for setting good goals. Let’s start with the S.M.A.R.T Goal guide. S.M.A.R.T is an acronym for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The credit for the creation of this concept is given to a George T. Doran in 1981. (Smartsheet, 2018) Let’s consider the concept.&lt;br /&gt;
Your goal must be specific. Specifically, you can define this by asking the who, what, where, when, and why. (2018) For whom is this goal for? What is the purpose of this goal? Where is this goal to be achieved? And why set this goal anyways? Second, measurable. How will you be able to measure how successful the implementation of your goal was? This is important. You want to be sure that the goal you wanted to achieve is not just an abstract art. It must be measurable so that you can know if you and especially others have achieved it. Third, is it achievable? Are you 45 years old, overweight, and have had hip replacement three weeks ago? Then would it be realistic for you to create a goal to be an NFL player by next year? If you continue to make goals that are not achievable, you will burn out from disappointment. Know your skill level and make goals to reach them.&lt;br /&gt;
Fourth, is your goal relevant? If you have a family and you want to start a soccer team with your family, have you thought to ask your family if they have any interest in soccer? If they hate the sport, your goal to have your family join or start a soccer team would not be very relevant. Finally, time-bound. I personally like to call this a deadline. Your goals must have a definite start and a definite end. This time-bound feature encapsulates, in my opinion, all of the previous other elements of the S.M.A.R.T goal process. If you cannot give yourself and others a definite time by which a goal is to be completed, there will never be a completion.&lt;br /&gt;
Create a Plan For How You Will Use Staff Professional Goals to Inform Your Own Staff Development Approach&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s apply the S.M.A.R.T goal to our preschool. You submit your goals to us when you arrive for your biannual counseling. Your goals itself are not evaluated. However, we do ask that you bring them into the evaluation process because one, your evaluator also must learn to set appropriate goals. Therefore, when he or she asks you about your goals, the learning curve is on both the evaluator and evaluated. The evaluator is asking you questions relating to whether or not your goals apply to the S.M.A.R.T goal concept and if they do not, perhaps you have something to teach the evaluator. Hopefully this process encourages mutual cooperation in the “getting things done” process for you and all of us here at the preschool. You’ve joined our organization because you feel there is something more to this center than just a mere occupation. Therefore, utilize the resources that your colleagues have. They will help you achieve those goals and to set more appropriately defined, specific, and achievable goals. Again, your goals you submit to us and your evaluator is not a part of your evaluation. Merely a platform for discussion and completion of the objectives in your life. We do not evaluate your goals because some people make exceptional liars. Goal setting is a personal objective. We could measure how well one would adhere to the S.M.A.R.T goal process but it is easy to fake a good goal. Instead, we judge and evaluate your character. We will know if your goals are real if you’re achieving them.&lt;br /&gt;
We also assume you will be here for at least a year. This is good news for us, because our mentorship program lasts one year. That is, you’ll be given three months to decide which of your colleague will mentor you. He or she must also agree to this mentorship program and obligate one year’s mentorship to you. That person must also have been with the preschool also for one year. Furthermore, the advantage of the mentorship program to you is that your mentor will also help facilitate the achievement of your goals. Of course, your colleagues also will be aware of your goals but your mentor will spearhead that initiative. Furthermore, if you have any questions relating to work life and performance, you can ask your mentor. This relationship should develop naturally and the only difference in between you and your mentor is the amount of time he or she has spent in our preschool. The mentor has no authority over you, only that he or she is a wellspring of resources and knowledge for you to extract. Since our curriculum is group teaching, you can officially shadow your mentor as much as needed. There is no classroom assigned to each teacher. Only a group divided by a beginner’s class, and an advanced class. You may feel free to ask the other teachers and watch what they do, but your mentor will most be interested in you shadowing him or her so that you can observe and modify teaching techniques to best fit your style of teacher and to improve the overall effectiveness of your method.&lt;br /&gt;
Identify Administrative and Organizational-Level Goals&lt;br /&gt;
Specific – I will develop a S.M.A.R.T mentorship goal program that involves my fellow colleagues. They will develop goals and have them shared with the rest of the educators by the second week of the final submission of everyone’s S.M.A.R.T goals. They will then brainstorm and with their mentors, will achieve at least 20% of the total staff’s goals by the end of the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals. We will create this program to foster a sense of achievement within the group of educators and to encourage cooperation and a sense of purpose in interacting with one another.&lt;br /&gt;
Measurable – 100% of the educators in our preschool program will submit a S.M.A.R.T goal program. 20% of them within the first year of the final submission of the S.M.A.R.T goals will be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;
Achievable – The creation of the program is viable but the obstacle lies on the ability of educators to create goals and to follow through with the goals.&lt;br /&gt;
Relevant – Educators will spend a significant amount of time with each other. There will be highs and lows. Having an objective to meet when there is downtime that is real and actionable will foster an environment that is growth oriented. When achievement of goals happens at the work place, the work place becomes a desirable place for employees to be.&lt;br /&gt;
Time-bound – 2 weeks after the final submission of S.M.A.R.T goals to organize and share goals. One year after final submission to achieve at least 20% of staff goals. I will implement the program by the end of January. The final submission will be by the end of February 15.&lt;br /&gt;
My two goals, one to create a S.M.A.R.T goal and mentorship program as well as facilitating the achievement of goals for 20% of the staff is so that I can encourage an environment of growth. I believe that connections can be made between all of the subjects of education. That is, one staff member’s goal to learn to ride a bike will have an educational connection with math and biology. The achievement of goals will encourage our educators to further their professional development. It will also make our educators better teachers.&lt;br /&gt;
Specific – I will take the preschool organization to new attendance numbers. We currently have 35 students. I will, by the end of January 2020 have increased that number to 41 students and I will also have by then, introduced a marketing element that will encourage parents to refer other parents to our school. This marketing element will be developed by the end of February and will be implemented until the end of January 2020, for reassessment of the effectiveness of the referral program.&lt;br /&gt;
Measurable – 35 to 41 students will be counted. I will measure the effectiveness of the referral program on the basis of how often new potential students will, along with their parents, bring along the pamphlet sheet that indicates it was passed onto the new potential family by one of our currently enrolled families. On this basis, I will measure the total amount of student families by the total amount of families that are referred. I will consider an average yearly 8% referral rate a great success.&lt;br /&gt;
Achievable – we have the facilities to be able to house the increase in students. At the moment here we have no maxed out the student to teacher ratio and in an attempt to maximize the total number of profits legally allowed while still being able to maintain our high quality of education, we have capped that number at 41 students. At this point we will begin the development of a waiting list on the basis of the success of the referral program.&lt;br /&gt;
Relevant – it is in the interest of the stakeholders, educators, and parents to maximize the total amount of students in the classroom, legally and ethically in order to ensure the students are able to interact with as many different students possible to increase their social experience, to increase the workload of the teachers in a professional matter so that the work is not too difficult nor too easy in order to develop a culture of purpose driven work, and to the parents so that our facility remains profitable and continues to teach the children and to stay in business.&lt;br /&gt;
Time-bound – Marketing program developed by the end of February and total amount of students will be at 41 students by the end of January 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
The reasons I have chosen these two goals is this – it is the responsibility of this preschool to maximize the profit. This is so that the facility can afford to maintain the high educational standard of the curriculum and so that the business can afford to stay in business. Furthermore, our educators depend on the financial success of the preschool for their own livelihood. The effects of the preschool shutting down due to bad business practices is catastrophic for parents, educators, and children. Secondly, it is irresponsible for the business to live hand to mouth. The preschool must have a pool of students to draw from when other students drop out due to the myriad of reasons life brings to the table. The referral program allows for the preschool to pick from the waiting list parents and families that are most dedicated to improving the educational condition of their child. It is difficult enough already to deal with parents that are not motivated in the collaborative process of raising a child as an educator. We will pick from the best families that desperately want to do what they can to bring the best out of their child. Perhaps the not so motivated families will go to our competitors when they tire of the waiting list.&lt;br /&gt;
In Addition to Setting Professional Goals, Implement a Reflective Practice Model&lt;br /&gt;
I have chosen to define reflective practice as to “strive to continuously achieve mastery of “increasingly higher levels of performance through the acquisition of more complex and refined cognitive mechanisms.”” (Marzano &amp;amp; Boogren, 2009) This is not a boring repetition of tasks. It is purposeful and thought driven practice in order to achieve a higher level of mastery. When the children come in with high energy and seemingly continue on and on it can sometimes be difficult for educators to sit and reflect on how things could have been done better. Furthermore, how can an educator apply reflective practice or deliberative practice? To address this question, I have developed a deliberative and reflective practice program for our educators to involve themselves in. It costs nothing to start a WordPress account. That is why I am requesting that our educators start a WordPress account with their name in the website field. There is no general requirement as to what needs to be on your website, but the concept is that you will begin to write out your reflections and deliberately practice your pedagogical skills on your WordPress account. This is where you will develop further as an educator. Not only that, when you’ve submitted the many different articles, you’ll find that you have an excellent portfolio of work that, should you decide to move to another field or another organization, your potential employer can see the amount of work you’ve completed in your field. This is an excellent and low-cost solution (free, minus your time) that will help you to reach new levels. Though there is no mandatory order to have our educators make a website, a total evaluation will be made on our educators, and having a WordPress or a website account with reflective and deliberative practice on the site will be considered for high marks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
EDU435&lt;br /&gt;
Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
My name is Kon Ham, and I am most especially honored and pleased to be a part of your team. Please allow me to describe my professional background. My parents are small business owners. Most career business owners will understand – you’ve got to lose a few businesses before you win it big. I’ve personally witnessed my parents losing more than their share of businesses as a result of their own mistakes and failures. I’ve also seen them profit greatly as a result of proper management and unrelenting passion and vision. So, I have been close if not a mere witness to the ups and downs of business. I’ve also helped to manage those businesses. My background in the management of this business is that I have always been close to the source of the business – that is, the customer. Usually in the line of work my parents are involved in, the manager is also the front clerk. Therefore, the front clerk is where the manager makes the most of his or her experience being nearest to the business. After sometime of this, I impulsively left the family business and joined a military branch – The United States Coast Guard.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States Coast Guard, I learned to work consistently under pressure. From boot camp to petty officer indoctrination school, or in business terms mid-level manager school and work specialty training, I was constantly put under the fire to deliver results despite a fire or not. I’ve also witnessed the workings of how an organization of 40,000 plus members operates and moves. And since my special training was involved in engineering, I was mostly utilized as a front-line technician. That means that myself and my subordinates worked in cramped, oily, dusty, and close quarters. So, I learned to work closely with my subordinates down in the trenches with them. By the end of the next month, I will have my Bachelor’s in Early Childhood Education. And by the end of summer, I plan to have my Master’s in Business Administration.&lt;br /&gt;
So, what does my professional development say about my experience? I believe it says that I am used to working in professions that are not very well appreciated nor is considered the “star of the show”. I am used to working in the background and playing pivotal roles in the support aspect of operations. I am used to working in small businesses with less than 20 employees and I am used to working in an organization that employs more than 40,000 people. I am used to working closely with my subordinates and I am used to getting very, very dirty. I think my experience speaks for how I feel about leadership. But for clarity, I can explain that my idea of leadership can be best conveyed in the actions of a little-known carpenter nearly 2,000 years ago. If you’ve grown up in a Christian background, you may already know this story. If not, I will summarize very quickly. In the background of his great betrayal of his close friend, and his impending execution by the hands of his own people, Jesus gathered his close friends and students for one of the last few times his associates would spend with him. Jesus prepared himself for a strange ritual – he began to wash the feet of his disciples. It was customary at that time to wash the feet of your guests as gesture of servitude. Jesus, the man that was claimed to be from God himself, the Lord of all Mankind, the one who was purportedly at the beginning creation and even before then and afterwards, was humbly washing the feet of his disciples and students as a gesture of servitude and humility. Of course, there was more to the washing of his disciples’ feet than a mere gesture of servitude, but that is where we begin in my explanation of how I view leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus was a leader. And if the Bible’s claims were to be true, that this Jesus character had all the authority on Earth, then he had every right to be as authoritative as he wanted. And yet, this man washed the feet of his disciples in order to serve their needs. This is my goal with you all. Though I am likely much more selfish and self-centered than this Jesus character, my goal is to wash your feet and to serve you. My goal as a leader is to equip you all with everything and in lacking nothing that you all may be able to also in turn, wash the feet of your students by serving their needs that they may be lacking in nothing. All too often we make a distinction between ourselves and our students as we are in a role of authority. And that authority can very easily be abused. Therefore, as a leader it is my utmost concern that I do not abuse this authority – and that a levy is created by serving your needs. Supervision is another aspect upon which I’d like to address. I want to be able to equip you all as leaders in your own right, striking it out on the frontiers on your own with your team. Supervision then is only necessary, if you all are responsible of your own accord, for when occasionally damage happens. It is life, and supervision, to my opinion, is judicial. That is, supervision arises when we need a judge and a jury to settle a dispute. I am doubtful that this need will arise often, but it does happen occasionally. In our occasion, it happens bi-annually when we come together for assessment of ourselves and our programs and our students. That is, we judge as a jury our own performance.&lt;br /&gt;
Outline of Supervision and Evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
I do not believe in a numerical grading system for the evaluation of my work nor for mine. Since our organization is not 40,000 strong like my previous employer, we can be much more qualitative in our evaluation and supervision. Our curriculum is straight forward. So is our goal. That is, to get children reading before they reach kindergarten. Therefor the results of our labor should be inherent in the students themselves. And since we share teaching the curriculum in no more than 30 minute intervals before the next teacher takes the teaching position of the one before him or her in an open classroom where all teachers are watching both the students and the teachers, it should be obvious then that the evaluation and supervisory outlines are daily and constant. Therefore, there is no quantitative approach to our evaluation. Every six months, however, teachers and supervisor will meet together in order to discuss practical issues. Is student A or B able to continue with our curriculum? Should he or she be instead expelled? Does any teacher have a problem noticed by the curriculum? And do any of the teachers have issues with any other teacher? Every six months the evaluation process will consist of letting out steam or unaired conflicts and to evaluate our students congregationally. Problem students cannot be allowed to continue in our curriculum, for the sake of the rest of the students. So every six months teachers will evaluate students to decide if one needs to be removed from our school. This is the extent of our evaluation and supervisory process.&lt;br /&gt;
Summary of Specific Evaluation Tool to Use&lt;br /&gt;
Our curriculum shall not have any specific evaluation tool to be used, especially since the state of Texas does not require one. However, for the sake of the exercise we will use the recommended appraisal of teachers recommended by the Texas Education Agency, an organization associated with the state of Texas. According to Texas Education Code §21.351, the recommended appraisal process be based on “observable, job-related behavior, including: (1) teachers’ implementation of discipline management procedures; and (2) the performance of teachers’ students.” (Texas Education Agency, 2018) This appraisal is recommended by the appraisal recommendation to be satisfied by the teacher’s supervisor or a person approved by the board of trustees. I am both of those. Under this recommended appraisal process, “appraisal for teachers must be detailed by category of professional skill and characteristic and must provide for separate ratings for each category. The appraisal process shall guarantee a conference between the teacher and appraiser. The conference shall be diagnostic and prescriptive with regard to remediation needed in overall performance and by category”. (Texas Education Agency, 2018) Therefore the recommended or specific evaluation tool shall be as listed above in the previous paragraphs seeing as the Texas Education Agency’s recommended appraisal tool matches our bi-annual congregationally led evaluation, on top of our evaluation of the students.&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of following our own evaluation process is this: first, as mentioned earlier, the state does not require a specific evaluation tool. Therefore, we have liberty to create our own tool. Second, because our curriculum is based around co-teaching. There are two classrooms in our curriculum. The first classroom is the beginner’s, and the second is the advanced. Both will follow this same teaching format. That is, all teachers will be in either the beginners or advanced class. And each teacher will teach take the center-stand and teach for no more than 30 minutes. Then another teacher that happens to be supervising the children from the back of the classroom will then teach the next 30-minute segment. And this continues. As you can see, the teachers are all constantly supervising each other. And since they are supervising each other, they all have a broad basis upon which to evaluate each other’s teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, a quantitative approach to evaluation is not needed. Instead, every six months teachers will gather and express encouragement or guidance on how their fellow colleagues could teach more efficiently or effectively. This style of co-teaching is not merely designed for the sake of the evaluation process but to mitigate the costly and high turn over rate that plagues the early childhood education industry. Teachers become burned out teaching a classroom of children for 8 to 10 hours a day for weeks on end. And since teachers are only teaching for 30 minutes each rotation, the total amount of teaching time is reduced to nearly half and therefore teachers can focus on providing a higher quality output of teaching and therefore that quality of work further stands for a higher quality of evaluation by his or her peers.&lt;br /&gt;
Self-Assessment Survey&lt;br /&gt;
Criteria Notes (Also include frequency. 1 for Low, 5 for High)&lt;br /&gt;
I feel I am contributing effectively and efficiently to the growth of my students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I am developing professionally as an educator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I am developing professionally as I guide and instruct my colleagues to be better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the workplace environment is one that I can be proud of and excited to enter each day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel there are outlets and solutions to the problems I encounter on a daily basis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that my work is valued by my students, peers, and parents as well as board of trustees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I am changing the world to become a better place through my actions here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have explored different avenues of employment but I still would rather work here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a desire to co-own this learning center so that I can take on more responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I am leaving behind a legacy that I and my peers can be proud of and stand behind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to Know You&lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to the start of our friendship, family, and professional development. It starts with getting to know who you are as a person. Would you kindly fill out this questionnaire? It helps me get a deeper and broader understanding of who you are. First, the basics.&lt;br /&gt;
How long have you been at this learning center?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your role or assigned position at this learning center?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the problems you see with our current program, and what are the strengths that you see with our program? Is there anything we should introduce? Is there anything we should discard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any information I need to know in order to most fully serve you and to cater to you as an individual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organization that is not constantly reforming and is not dynamic to the changes of the student’s needs, the economical market’s needs, and to the parent’s needs is a dying organization. What are the biggest problems you predict this organization will encounter in the next coming years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation Plan&lt;br /&gt;
On the basis of the two questionnaires I’ve asked from you all, I will plan to do the following: reform is necessary and while the mission statement and core values must be consistent, if they are still relevant to us, the rest of the organization must be adapting to changing needs. I’m sure some of you are concerned about the growing need for diversity sensitive classrooms. I am aware that the classrooms of today will not look like the classrooms of tomorrow. And what about the falling price of technology and how that enables us to better teach our students? What technological devices do we include in the classroom of the future, today? And how can we make our classroom environment the place where professional educators can be proud to call their second home? The first step to the change is dialogue and discussion, which is why we will set aside time every bi-annually. This session is designed to, in a congregational form, discuss future developments and potential problems to be resolved. We must all stay on the same page, and in order to do so there must be a culture of free dialogue. Often, we must say things we feel uncomfortable to say but we do not. I cannot guarantee that we will always feel good about what is said but I can guarantee that I will be a part of the culture in which discussion happens all of the time, without repercussion. It is through dialogue that truth is revealed slowly but surely. Therefore, that is the first step I will implement. It is in that spirit of free discussion that I also intend to encourage in our evaluation of each other. We are limited by own knowledge and experience. There is something that you as a professional educator can and must say in order for your colleague to become better. And one day that same attitude will benefit you as well. Because such a process of growth is reciprocal, it is imperative that we begin that process as quickly as possible. That first step begins with you, expressing your thoughts, feelings, and ideas to each other.&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to problems that need action and reconciliation, the supervisory role that we all play must change into the role of judicial processes. We will all act as a jury in order to judge the event and to prescribe a solution. In all of us is a judge also that must make the decision and take steps to correcting a wrong. This also happens in our bi-annual meeting. What about staff members that cannot or are unable to meet the expectations that we hold collectively as a staff? I can only execute the final wish of the staff members, who must collectively decide whether or not to keep the staff member or to release him or her. If the need for a prescription instead of a removal of the staff member is in order, then the staff members will also collectively decide which actions to take. I have purposely left out specifics of what the treatment ought to be for the various problems relating to performance ought to be. This is because I am hoping to create an organization that can be constantly reforming and dynamic on the basis of what our core beliefs are, as defined in our mission statement and core values. Documentation of all actions that the staff wishes to take is documented in the meeting by all party members. Of course, we can utilize technology to our advantage and we can record the meeting through the use of a recorder, in case we need to look back at our past decisions. To clearly define what and when and where these bi-annual meetings will take place, I will suggest the following. First, the meeting shall take place in February and in August, both on the 15th of each month, more or less depending on revolving weekends. They will be held in our classrooms, and we shall meet for as long as necessary to convey needed messages, critiques, evaluations of teachers, expulsions of students, release of staff members, voicing of concerns for the future projects, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
Evaluation of This Plan and of My Leadership&lt;br /&gt;
How then can I be evaluated as a role of a supervisor and director of this learning center? There must be a few points of criteria that I must specifically meet. That is, cohesion of the faculty members, productivity of the teachers, results of the students in being able to read before kindergarten, the expelling of faculty members unable to meet standards, the expelling of students that are causing problems to the curriculum and the rest of the students, and the economical success of the learning center. As we say in the naval service, it is a matter of whether or not I am running “a tight ship”. Therefore, the previously mentioned criteria should serve as a guideline of evaluation that I must meet when I am reviewed by the board of trustees. Since we focus on qualitative assessments of each other I am also held to the same standards that our faculty impress upon each other. This refinement process should occur through a process of evaluations that all of us incur when our bi-annual meeting occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Organizational Framework – Vision Statement&lt;br /&gt;
Imagination Day Care Center is a Christian day care ministry that provides high quality child care that results in children reading before they enter into kindergarten. This ministry seeks to serve the local communities and families by providing this high-quality child care service by molding children into disciplined, consistent, and literate adults that seek to change the world around them to make the world a better place – this change to make the world a better place first starts with the families of the local communities and families that Imagination Day Care Center seeks to serve. Imagination Day Care Center seeks to pursue these goals because the staff members of Imagination Day Care Center believe in the good works aspect of a Christian. That is that, “Faith Without Good Works is Dead”. With this belief that faith must be applied into productive practice, Imagination Day Care Center equips staff members all tools necessary to mold children into Christians that will one day change the world for a more prosperous and peaceful time.&lt;br /&gt;
Organizational Framework – Mission Statement&lt;br /&gt;
Imagination Day Care Center exists to provide high-quality child-care service in order to entice families of the surrounding community to learn about Jesus Christ. Imagination Day Care Center acts as an outreach ministry in order to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the molding of children in order that they can be like “salt and light” to their families and beyond. Imagination Day Care Center first serves God through faithful ministry and practice of faith by action, which is to teach children to read and write before entering kindergarten. Second, Imagination Day Care Center serves the mothers and fathers of those children with the belief that God has given responsibility and authority to these parents to raise the children into productive and passionate members of society. Finally, Imagination Day Care Center serves the children who will one day grow older and ready to take on responsibilities to make the world a better place through the firm conviction of Christian morality and values. These morals and values come through Judeo-Christian values. That is one, that people will one day be held accountable to God for their actions. Second, that hypocrisy is not acceptable of a Christian, or that “you must remove the plank before your own eye before attempting to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” And third, that Christians must love God first, and to love their neighbors second. With these convictions Imagination Day Care Center seeks to raise children that are considerate of their own actions and are concerned with the well-being of others because of the fact that one day they too will be held accountable for their works and their actions.&lt;br /&gt;

Big Day for PreK is “a proven-effective comprehensive program that ensures kindergarten readiness by building the foundation for success in school and life.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Specifically, the Big Day for PreK curriculum is split into six compartments: developmentally appropriate practices, daily responsive instruction, evaluation programs, extended play, daily math and writing, and teacher and child interactions. This curriculum is encapsulated in five “elements of success”. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Those elements are big experiences, meaningful conversations, a wide variety of the best children’s literature and nonfiction, innovative technology, and comprehensive curriculum. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) There is considerable research to the contribution that Big Day curriculum has on the improve rate of literacy and mathematical improvement on students. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) The benefit to this curriculum is that Big Day focuses on social-emotional development. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) According to Big Day, “Every theme in Big Day for PreK has a social-emotional focus that emphasizes what is essential for helping children be future-ready.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Big Day also focuses on a liberal arts approach to learning, which integrates all subjects of learning into one experience. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Since Imagination Day Care emphasizes a collaborative approach, Big Day curriculum fills the need for a curriculum that partners with families and educators to provide an educational service that encourages communication back and forth all parties. Since Imagination Day Care also emphasizes children being able to read before kindergarten, Big Day curriculum also fills the need to have children learning and developing language skills through providing opportunities for “modeling and reinforcing conversation, vocabulary, and sentence structures across social and academic settings.” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) Finally, Big Day provides evaluation that provides ample opportunities for Imagination Day Care center’s educators to fill in gaps of learning when needed, and to if necessary, provide alternative intervention. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Job Description for Teacher&lt;br /&gt;
Relevant Duties&lt;br /&gt;
Duties for Imagination Day Care Center educators shall be as follows: Educators are expected to be held responsible to the parents and to God in the proper upbringing up the child. Educators will diligently apply the Big Day curriculum towards the students without fail. Potential educators shall be advised that the work of education does not fall merely between 6:30 to 6:00PM, but rather that the work of the educator is that he or she is working 24/7 for the raising of these children into responsible adults. In essence, potential educators are to be reminded that the work of an educator is a lifestyle and not merely a profession. Therefore, potential applicants may be expected to show in attendance events that may arise outside of the normal day care operations, in particular for social events or for purposes of raising awareness of the day care’s mission statement and vision. Because this day care operates on a belief that the educators are all workers involved in the work of the Kingdom of Heaven, they may be asked to involve themselves in the cleaning of facilities in order that they may take pride in their work as educators and the facility that is producing future high-quality adults. Teachers may also be asked to fill in for other teachers that call in sick or to provide for transportation for families that may encounter emergency situations where a child cannot return home.&lt;br /&gt;
Certification Requirements/ Required/Preferred Background&lt;br /&gt;
Imagination Day Care does not require potential applicants to have a college degree. Minimum standards are as follows: Applicant must be 18 with a high school diploma or equivalency. Part time applicants must be at least 16 and without a high school diploma, but will require parental approval. Experience is not necessary as on the job training will be provided for. Potential applicant must provide proof of membership in church of their choosing.&lt;br /&gt;
Plan for Event&lt;br /&gt;
Why the Event is Taking Place&lt;br /&gt;
This event is taking place to promote the use of the day care facility as an incubator for community events in which families can meet other families and the educators in order to more fully engage with those around them, to take advantage of the networking hub available to them and the available social capital, and to encourage families to see Imagination Day Care Center as the engine or facilitator of integration of families, communities and educators. Therefore, Imagination Day Care Center will provide a barbeque and an outside movie to families, educators, and children.&lt;br /&gt;
Who is Expected to Participate&lt;br /&gt;
All educators are expected to participate in order that the families may meet and engage with the educators that there might be a fluid dynamic of exchange of communication that facilitates a learning environment for the child that equips the child for the future. Families of these children are expected but not demanded.&lt;br /&gt;
When the Event Will Take Place&lt;br /&gt;
The event will take place on the third Friday of the month. It will take place at approximately 5:30PM and end at 9:00PM.&lt;br /&gt;
Where the Event Will Take Place&lt;br /&gt;
The event will take place at the day care facility. Food will be had outside and the movie will also be had outside in the playground.&lt;br /&gt;
How Long the Event Will Take Place For&lt;br /&gt;
Since the event begins at 5:30PM and ends at 9:00PM, that would be approximately 3.5 hours in which the event will last for.&lt;br /&gt;
How the Parents Will Receive Notice of the Event&lt;br /&gt;
Imagination Day Care has captured the addresses of the parents at the beginning of enrollment. Therefore Imagination Day Care will send notices to parents through mail as well as sending home a pamphlet making aware the parents of the event.&lt;br /&gt;
How Will Staff be Involved in the Event&lt;br /&gt;
A volunteer will be made for the preparation of the barbeque. Food will be provided for by the day care. The rest of the staff are encouraged to either help prepare the food or to mingle with the family members and children. The day care director or supervisor will be available to float to necessary tasks if needed. The objective of the event is to provide an opportunity for families to relax and to share information with other families, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;
The first problem that I have noticed is the lack of communication and support from Yolanda and the community of educators involved in the process of teaching Daniel. Because Yolanda was unable to read and write in Spanish or English, there is a significant obstacle to overcome when Daniel takes home school work and when attempting to involve Yolanda in the process of supporting Daniel’s education. Because Daniel acts up, there is a continuing build-up of frustration from Yolanda because she was unable to communicate with the teachers and the principle regarding Daniel’s behavior. Furthermore, Yolanda is a single mother. She also happened to move to the area as a result of a job transfer. This could imply that Yolanda and Daniel are not considered financial stable and may live paycheck to paycheck, adding to further instability and insecurity in the household. Yolanda must also rely upon Teresa to enroll Daniel in school and to communicate with the educators. This also adds to the friction of the relationship and learning dynamic for Daniel. What if Teresa is not around for the week and the teachers must pass on information to Daniel? Yolanda relies upon Teresa.&lt;br /&gt;
The second problem is the misinterpretation of Daniel’s behavior and language competency with being deaf or perhaps having a language disability like his mother. So instead of being placed in a class of his peers, Daniel was placed in a special needs class for children with hearing disorders, speech disabilities, or learning disabilities relating to cognitive and physical motor dysfunction. There was a significant difference from when he was in the class for special needs and when he was placed in a normal class. There are many different factors at play here as to why Daniel began to act up in the classroom for the children without disabilities perhaps relating to the fact that Daniel is the only Latino in the classroom and the rest of the children being Caucasian and Asia, or perhaps the initial misdiagnosis of Daniel as a special needs student, or perhaps relating to Yolanda’s frustration and being a single mother without flexibility of schedule to fully support Daniel in his academic endeavors, but the problem persists as Daniel begins to exert his frustrations in the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
Ms. Weaver is a monolingual English speaker. She is the principle of the school that Daniel attends. Ms. Weaver assumes that Yolanda is a monolingual Spanish speaker because she watches Teresa fill out the necessary forms to enroll Daniel in school. Ms. Weaver also assumes Daniel does not speak English like his mother and that conclusion was based on the lack of Daniel’s responsiveness to Ms. Weaver. Ms. Weaver may have also made this conclusion prior to his official assessment by Ms. Weaver based on the observations Ms. Weaver had made about Yolanda being helped by Teresa and from Daniel’s general lack of responsiveness. When Ms. Weaver made an official assessment of Daniel, she spoke loudly and slowly. She tries to get Daniel to write with a pencil as well as with flashcards to assess colors, numbers, and letters. On this basis Ms. Weaver made the decision to put Daniel into a special need’s classroom. Likely Ms. Weaver found that, in her professional opinion, that Daniel had some form of learning disability because of his withdrawnness.&lt;br /&gt;
Yolanda moved to the area as a result of a forced relocation. She speaks Spanish but is illiterate. She is unable to speak English. She is also 28 years old and is the mother of Daniel, who is 5. Yolanda is aware of the fact that Daniel was excelling in his previous school of bilingual speaking bicultural teachers and classmates. Because of the lack of her ability to understand or speak English, she elicits the help of Teresa, her neighbor, to enroll Daniel in the new school. Daniel is acting out and is disrupting the classroom environment. Yolanda is confused and embarrassed about the situation because she cannot understand why Daniel is acting the way that he is. Yolanda probably has many concerns that are tied in with both her job, her speaking situation, the lack of social resources relating to moving to a new city, and the inability to communicate with Daniel’s teachers because of her language barrier. There could be a chance that Yolanda has no idea that Daniel is placed in a special needs program as a result of the inaccurate assessment made by Ms. Weaver. Furthermore, Yolanda cannot understand the needs of the teachers who may need to communicate important information to Yolanda concerning Daniel if Teresa, Yolanda’s interpreter, is not around to translate for Yolanda. We don’t know how often Teresa is around but if Yolanda must rely solely upon Teresa for information concerning Daniel then there could also be a sense of frustration there also. Likely Yolanda has also spoken with Daniel about his behavior in class. Maybe there is something that Daniel has told Yolanda and will not tell his teachers and that Yolanda could express on Daniel’s behalf.&lt;br /&gt;
Teresa is the neighbor of Yolanda. Yolanda relies upon Teresa to be able to communicate to the principle and teachers. Apart from what little is said about Teresa, we can assume that Teresa has a positive relationship with Yolanda and cares for her and Daniel to some certain degree, because she is going out of her way to interpret for Yolanda and to help Yolanda enroll Daniel into school. She may hear concerns about Daniel from Yolanda concerning his acting out. Teresa may want to do something about it but could feel that it is not her place to intervene on behalf of Yolanda and Daniel. We don’t know the level of her interpreting skill so there could be a miscommunication that is happening between Yolanda, Teresa, and the school educators. Surely Yolanda was aware of Daniel’s academic performance and his previous school. And we can safely assume that Yolanda and Daniel speak Spanish fluently at home and that Daniel, according to Yolanda, does not have a hearing or learning problem. Then why was he allowed to be placed in a special needs class? Teresa may have miscommunicated the assessment by Ms. Weaver.&lt;br /&gt;
Daniel is five years old. Daniel has just moved to a new town and is enrolled in a class where first, he was grouped with classmates that had learning disabilities and possibly other cognitive and motor dysfunctions. He may have begun to learn sign language in order to communicate with his other classmates. Daniel has historically done very well in school, specifically his previous school where the majority of his classmates were bilingual and bicultural. This situation where he has moved to a new town that may be mostly populated with Caucasian and Asians as a result of a forced relocation his mother endured in order to keep her job may be stressful to Daniel. Daniel, if he was excelling at his previous school, may then have exhibited different personality traits that he began to express at his new school. His withdrawn behavior and separation anxiety may be the result of the sudden change in his life. After being placed in a remedial classroom for three or four months, he is now placed in a new classroom where he again is forced to change and adapt. His acting out may be a result of a desire to see his mother where she is called in frequently to address the issue that Daniel is having. As a result of the testing that Ms. Ramirez gave, we can see that Daniel should have no trouble at all understand direction and guidance from his teachers. This is what leads me to believe that he is acting out due to personal and emotional issues he may be experiencing from all of the sudden change going on in his life.&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Choi teaches the classroom that Daniel is currently in. Daniel acts up in class and Mr. Choi had previously assumed that Daniel had such problems because of a possible hearing deficiency or the assumption that Daniel had a learning disability because of the assumption that Yolanda also had a learning disability. Mr. Choi, until Ms. Ramirez made the conclusion that Daniel was fluent in both English and Spanish, may not have heard Daniel speak much in class and may have seen Daniel remain withdrawn. Perhaps Daniel picked up sign language and began to communicate only in sign language with his fellow classmates. This could have led to further misunderstanding of Daniel’s situation. Likely Mr. Choi had attempted to speak with Yolanda and to communicate with her the problems that Daniel had been experiencing. Perhaps Mr. Choi also felt a sense of frustration like Yolanda in being unable to assist Daniel in class and then having to bear the burden of Daniel’s acting out.&lt;br /&gt;
Ms. Ramirez may have also been shocked to find that Daniel was fluent in both English and Spanish. She may have also been in wonder that Daniel was placed in a special needs class for a period of three or four months given Daniel’s proficiency in both languages. There is no indication that Ms. Ramirez spoke with Yolanda concerning Daniel’s ability and that he would be placed in yet another new class because of the results.&lt;br /&gt;
C/D&lt;br /&gt;
The first opportunity would be a chance for interagency collaboration between the public school and the social workers. The cultural and language barriers could have easily overcome if the public school had a system in which multicultural social workers would come by the school and to assess a student together with the other teachers all the while allowing someone like Yolanda to be involved in the project to help Daniel become acclimated to the new classroom and to avoid misdiagnosis of ability. Having social workers involved in the school that have the ability to interpret language and to comprehend social culture would be of a great benefit to the schools. The creation of a system of social workers with multicultural backgrounds working with the school teachers and principles would be an opportunity to further enhance the education of children like Daniel all the while preventing disruption of the classroom. This program would help to reduce assessments on the basis of bias as in, for example, when Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi assumed that because Yolanda could not read or write, that she had a learning ability that was inherited by Daniel.&lt;br /&gt;
As far as we know it and on the basis of their actions towards Daniel, it could be assumed that Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi have not had much experience with bilingual and bicultural students. On top of the solution proposed of an interagency collaborative effort, Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi can head programs to deeper understand the many facets of multiculturalism. While the students have Asian minority students making up the majority of the classroom along with Caucasians, educational programs that emphasize the many different cultures that can exist in any given classroom can be integrated into the classroom. While there is no expectation for Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi to learn Spanish, having a pool of resources like interpreters and other educators that are local and engaged to draw from would be incredibly beneficial to Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi. Perhaps Ms. Ramirez knows other bilingual and bicultural social workers or teachers that Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi could learn from.&lt;br /&gt;
Having a network of bilingual teachers could help in the miscommunication that Yolanda experiences being confused and embarrassed as to why Daniel is acting out. Ms. Weaver, the special needs teacher, and Mr. Choi are likely experienced in the educational field. There is a large amount of resources that Yolanda and Daniel cannot draw from because of a lack of cohesion of purpose as a result of being unable to communicate with the educators. And Yolanda and Daniel both have an opportunity that the teachers could learn from – the expansion of a multicultural program that would benefit the teachers in their deeper understanding of the education of the future and for future students to adjust well and appropriately to the classroom which accordingly matches the student’s needs.&lt;br /&gt;
In the meantime, a resolution can be reached by Daniel’s instructors and Yolanda. First, there needs to be a meeting put in place with all of the parties. Daniel will not need to be there. But Mr. Choi, the special needs teacher, Ms. Weaver, and Ms. Ramirez will need to meet with Yolanda to update Yolanda with the events that have taken place since Daniel was enrolled in school. An apology by Ms. Weaver on behalf of the school would be appropriate but not exactly necessary. Finally, a dual interpretation by Ms. Ramirez and Teresa would be called for in the expectations that the Mr. Choi and Ms. Weaver would have for Daniel. I would also propose that Ms. Weaver contact the previous school Daniel was enrolled in so that Ms. Weaver can get a fuller, deeper understanding of Daniel’s previous academic ability in order to fit him into a curriculum or classroom that most suits his needs. Finally, I recommend that Ms. Ramirez officially, with permission from her supervisor and with an official system in place for children like Daniel to have a “cultural liaison” in that Ms. Ramirez contact Daniel and Yolanda monthly or quarterly, ideally monthly, in order that Ms. Ramirez can pass on information from Yolanda and Daniel onto the school so that the school also has a channel of communication.&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, I would recommend that Teresa also be implemented in this program, possibly with financial incentive in order to compensate Teresa for her time. I would recommend that Teresa serve as a form of cultural hub in which other members that are from the Spanish community could be contacted by the school administrators. These people that are contacted are the ones that have bilingual capability and are able to help the needs of Yolanda and other future at-risk students that are falling behind due to misunderstanding with both culture and language. The Spanish community acts as an extended family. Therefore Yolanda, Daniel, and other students and parents could rely on some members of this community through Teresa. There needs to be a qualification process for this in the form of a background check and language proficiency test but despite that process the author believes there will still be many candidates available for translation and interpreting skills as well as provide logistical support for Yolanda.&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;br /&gt;
The first response by the teachers would be that Ms. Weaver simply speak to Daniel as if he were a normal child. In fact, he is. Ms. Weaver mistakenly assumed that Daniel was incapable of English because of the assumption that he was either deaf or had inherited a learning problem from his mother. Very simply, Ms. Weaver can begin to immediately build rapport with Daniel by speaking to Daniel like a normal child and on the same eye level. Ms. Weaver may soon learn that Yolanda is indeed a single mother, that she was forced to relocate here, and that Yolanda is experiencing some trouble adjusting to the new city through the use of an interpreter. Ms. Weaver may, through the channel of the interpreter, find more grounds for understanding and empathy through Yolanda and naturally through Yolanda, to Daniel.&lt;br /&gt;
The second response would be to Mr. Choi, who could learn a few catch phrases and idioms common in the Spanish language, to provide for Daniel and to help Daniel absorb the culture shock of being in a classroom with only Caucasians and Asians. A simple “hello” or “how are you” in Spanish would very easily convey to Daniel that Mr. Choi is desiring to meet on a two-way street, instead of Daniel perhaps taking the mistaken view that Mr. Choi is against him. Through the use of simple sayings and phrases Mr. Choi conveys to Daniel that Mr. Choi is the advocate to Daniel.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the third response would be to the unnamed special needs teacher. Understandably his or her superior made the conclusion that Daniel was a special needs child, but perhaps the special needs educator could stand to benefit by incorporating a secondary test in which the original assessor, the principle, in this case, Ms. Weaver, stands to be vindicated in her conclusion that a child is special needs or not. And on the chance that the child is not special needs, then all is well, the child is sent to the appropriate classroom. Furthermore, did the special needs teacher know that Daniel was from a Spanish speaking background? Also, then, like in the case of Mr. Choi, the special needs instructor could benefit from the learning of a few words and greetings in Spanish with the assumption that who knows? Perhaps Daniel would respond in Spanish and the special needs teacher could have stood to doubt the conclusion made by Mr. Choi and Ms. Weaver in that Daniel was possibly hard of hearing.&lt;br /&gt;
F&lt;br /&gt;
The first long-term response would be to, similar what was mentioned earlier with Teresa being a cultural networking hub, the school could develop a system that engages members of the community of the student that is currently enrolled in the school. For example, is the student from a culture that speaks the Korean language? Then outreaches to the local church or Korean business association could be made, a background check completed, and that person utilized to be a translator for the student as well as being an advocate for the student.&lt;br /&gt;
A second long-term response would be to collaborate with other schools that have a diverse enrollment of students that have multicultural backgrounds. The students from other schools could organize events for the students and for the teachers where the teachers would meet other teachers in a professional atmosphere to learn from and to share teaching strategies. The students could also meet with students from Daniel’s school and “school pep” could be encouraged. Daniel and other students that feel marginalized could feel that though in Daniel’s situation he may feel isolated that it is not the end of the world and that opportunities abound everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, a third long term solution would be that, though the teachers may not necessarily enjoy it, a form of mandated training that is taken every six months in which the school collectively takes training online that teaches diversity and awareness of the varying levels of multiculturalism that exists in the modern public school today. In this format, a teacher would take a multicultural class that lasts no more than 45 minutes in a format that is distributed online. This method would reinforce desired behaviors from teachers that benefit the student and overall curriculum of the school.&lt;br /&gt;
G&lt;br /&gt;
The plan of action follows: Ms. Ramirez is now the official spokesperson to Yolanda. Teresa is welcome to join any event and discussion relating to Yolanda and Daniel whenever she likes. Ms. Weaver and Mr. Choi will continue building rapport with Daniel beginning with simple Spanish greetings. Now that Ms. Ramirez has illuminated the situation concerning Daniel and his normal abilities to speak English as well as Spanish, she will likely be interested in continuing to be an advocate for Daniel. So, Ms. Ramirez, Mr. Choi, and Ms. Weaver will collaborate to provide a goodness of fit for Daniel in his learning environment. Yolanda will cooperate with Ms. Ramirez on a more continual basis, likely a monthly basis in which Ms. Ramirez translates problems relating to Daniel and solutions in which Mr. Choi and Ms. Weaver will implement with the full understanding of Yolanda and Ms. Ramirez. The school will, until it finds a means for a community of cultural influences that will stand as a temporary replacement for the administrators until a network is built.&lt;/p&gt;

observed and assessed by the Child Care Organization in order to present to me a yearly progress report that involves information relating to the scholastic achievement of my child. I am aware that I can opt out of this at any time, as long as written request is given to the Child Care Organization. I am aware that this observation and assessment is a year-long evolution and that I will be presented with a portfolio at the end of this years’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preface&lt;br /&gt;
Before I continue with the assessment information that has been compiled for you, I want to be able to explain the four types of assessments that were accessed in order to create this portfolio for you. The four assessments we’ve used for the creation of Josue’s portfolio were a running record, anecdotal record, observation scale, and a checklist. The first two are mainly for use by the teachers here at Child Care Organization but they are also helpful to you too, as a parent that you can visualize what life has been like for Josue and in particular, through the eyes of the teacher. The second two assessments are also utilized by teachers but you may find them to be more beneficial to you as the latter two assessments involve checklists and rating scales so that you can gauge for yourself where your child falls in relation to the expectations of the curriculum we have here. If we have done our job correctly, you should see an improvement in Josue’s development from when he first enrolled here to one year into the future.&lt;br /&gt;
The first assessment will be a running record. Originally, we were not entirely sure of Josue’s language development. We are aware of his lack of exposure to the English language at home and his cultural upbringing – we are also aware that Josue struck us as a bright young man. However, we wanted to be sure that his language development was not being delayed as a result of other issues unrelated to English being his secondary language. We were also not sure if he was unable to understand our instructions because of a potential hearing disorder. Given the fact that Josue is learning English at a consistent pace from the interaction of his peers, it was not likely that Josue had an impairment of hearing – but we wanted to be sure of his condition and where we stood in his language development. Finally, we typically start our assessments with a running record because it gives us an opportunity to step back from participating in the classroom and to allow us to record as much live data as possible from Josue’s interactions with the environment and his peers. Specifically, running records record almost everything that Josue’s will do in the given amount of time that we utilize in his assessment. This method is naturalistic so we can sit and observe Josue “as he is”. This gives us an opportunity to step away from our own biases as educators. By making a running record assessment, we capture everything Josue does so that we can later make an analysis of his behavior and development.&lt;br /&gt;
The second assessment we utilized for Josue is an anecdotal record. The benefit to an anecdotal record is that unlike a running record, we can begin to record events that are significant to our goals and objectives relating to Child Care Organization’s curriculum. That is, our teachers now begin to choose what behaviors to record from Josue. This allows us to highlight for you, as the parent, and for ourselves, as educators, events that are significant to Josue. Specifically, we were looking for emerging behaviors that indicated that Josue was displaying progression in his language learning of English. Furthermore, we can mark baseline observations, or standards in which Josue’s language development revolved around, so that when comparing baseline observations and emerging skills, we can gauge that progression in a more scientific method. To further elaborate our process of running records and anecdotal records, we used running records to first establish baseline observations in case any of our biases would potentially hinder Josue’s academic potential. Once a running record baseline observation was established, we began to taper off running records into anecdotal records. This movement from running records to anecdotal records has two functions. The first function is to give Josue as much attention as needed in both observation environments. A running record involves that a participant be detached from Josue and to observe him from a naturalistic view. This means that there can only be one observer per child. This moves us into the second function of tapering our records from running records to anecdotal records. As with all children, educators must be involved in the lives of the children and to make an impact upon them. Running records do not allow for this in the sense that the educator is no longer participating in the classroom. Anecdotal records allow for the teacher to return to Josue and to be involved in Josue’s curriculum in a very personal way, all the while capturing key, vital moments of Josue’s progression.&lt;br /&gt;
Third, we’ve developed an observation scale, or rating scale so that we can quantify the data that Josue accumulates as he navigates through our curriculum. What we mean by quantify is to take the running and anecdote records and to drive them into a clear and concise direction of where Josue needs to be. The observational scale provides teachers with expectations of achievement for Josue and also provides a numerical value for Josue’s progress. This numerical value can help us and you as a parent gauge in another way, besides the anecdotal and running records the progress Josue has made. Furthermore, as a parent you can see clearly the expectations and goals of the curriculum set forth in the observation scale.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the observational scale and the checklist are a major advantage to you as a parent because you can see in front of you quantifiable and clear data that ideally, you’ll work with us in order to meet those objectives. The checklist serves also as an important piece of assessment that we utilize as a final assessment of Josue’s year at the Child Care Organization. This checklist is used nearing the final semester of Josue’s term and is used to create a new curriculum for Josue for the next year – a curriculum that is exciting, challenging, and also rewarding. This checklist is used as a final assessment because there are significant challenges to only using a checklist as a sole use of assessment. That is, there is not enough data for us to make an assessment of Josue to professionally and ethically continue with his curriculum on the basis of one checklist. Therefore, we have used this checklist as a form of graduation requirements at the last part of Josue’s term. We assume that enough data has been compiled on his behalf through the anecdotal, running, and observational scale records. This checklist benefits you because you can very quickly see a summary of the information and achievement that Josue has been involved in the past year. This checklist should give you a sense of encouragement that your child is headed in the right direction and that the curriculum has done its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observation via Running Record Part 2&lt;br /&gt;
Josue is exchanging conversation with his peers. It is free time. Josue is walking up to Lisa and says, “Lisa, what are you doing?” as he watches over her shoulder. Lisa replies saying “I’m coloring an elephant. You can color this elephant with me, if you want.” Josue makes eye contact when she says this and he puts his hands in his pockets. Josue takes his hands and points to Lisa and says “color”. Lisa shakes her head up and down and repeats, “color”. Another teacher, Ms. Fritzel passes by and says to Josue “Josue can you please take a seat so that I can give you your coloring supplies?” Josue stands around, keeping eye contact with Mrs. Fritzel as she takes him by hand and leads him to his chair. Josue sits and says to Mrs. Fritzel, “Sit, thank you”. Mrs. Fritzel passes to Josue the coloring supplies as Josue says to Mrs. Fritzel, “Mrs. Fritzel, thank you.” Mrs. Fritzel responds “You’re very welcome.” Josue is handed a tray of coloring supplies and watches Lisa color. He begins to color in the drawing that is on his desk. Mrs. Fritzel says to Josue, “You can color the elephant any color you’d like. Just be sure to stay within the lines.” Josue looks at Mrs. Fritzel, nods, and says “Thank you.” He then looks to Lisa’s drawing and begins to draw. He picks up the crayon, looks at Lisa’s drawing, and then back to his. He begins to color in the elephant. He looks around at other student’s drawings before resuming coloring of his drawing. He colors within the lines. He is coloring but looks to Lisa’s drawing every so often. Mrs. Fritzel calls to Josue, “Josue, can you please pass this scissor to Lisa?” Josue looks at Mrs. Fritzel and stares at her for a moment. Josue stands up, walks to Mrs. Fritzel and stands there. Mrs. Fritzel says, “Yes Josue. Very good. Now take this scissor to Lisa. Take this scissor to Lisa.” Mrs. Fritzel then points to Lisa, and then nods to Josue. Josue takes the scissors and gives it to Lisa. Josue then stands there before Mrs. Fritzel notices. “Yes Josue, sit.” Josue then says “sit” before sitting. He then says “Thank you Mrs. Fritzel.”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observation via Anecdotal Record Part 2&lt;br /&gt;
Context: Josue has been enrolled in the Child Care Organization for nearly 6 months since his initial series of assessments in February. He is now involved in a science experiment involving the use of diet Coca Cola and Mentos.&lt;br /&gt;
Josue is sitting down with the rest of his classroom. He says to John, “John, sit here with me” as he pats the carpeted floor of the classroom. John sits next to him. Mrs. Fritzel sits in front of the children. She says to them all, “Class, do you remember the word we used for why we got such a messy explosion from the diet Cola and the Mentos candy?” Josue raises his hand. Mrs. Fritzel says to Josue, “Yes Josue, do you know what the word was? Please, stand up to speak.” Josue stands up, and says, “Mrs. Fritzel. The word we used last week was reaction.” Mrs. Fritzel responds, “Very good Josue. Please have a sit.” Josue sits down.&lt;br /&gt;
Summary: Josue is beginning to show that he can excel with Mrs. Fritzel’s instructions. He no longer hesitates when Mrs. Fritzel asks him to sit, stand, or other basic commands. This science experiment involving the diet Cola and Mentos seems to have gone well. Josue is learning words other than the words of his peers. He is learning scientific processes as he is expanding his vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

Setting Josue’s English comprehension as well as verbal ability to speak is tested through a means of a checklist. This process is a one-day process in which Josue is reviewed for his general ability to master the English language in order to advance to the next level of Child Care Organization’s curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

Ability to explain scientific processes or fictional accounts of books read in a manner that is understandable to listeners x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion, Analysis, and Moving Forward&lt;br /&gt;
Josue demonstrates great skill in being able to adapt to his environment. As you can see from his assessment portfolio, he probably does not have any learning disabilities. This may seem obvious in hindsight, but there is need to be sure in case a misdiagnosis results in precious time being wasted on both our end on and Josue’s end. Time is valuable, and is the only thing that we will never get back. Therefore, we have created this assessment so that you as Josue’s parents understand the amount of time well spent Josue has invested into this curriculum. Josue has, if you see his portfolio, advanced greatly under our curriculum. There is no doubt – Josue has the ability to adapt to his circumstances and to show great potential for the future. His language learning ability has greatly improved and now Josue appears to show very little difficulty in overcoming the environment he has been placed, in our curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, we must consider where Josue must go next. Josue is displaying ability to learn at the next level of Child Care Organization. This is obvious. However, we would like to be able to recommend any sort of further possibilities so that Josue can maximize his time spent here and to accelerate him, and if possible, to make him superior over his peers. The first is that he be given an opportunity to attend a summer camp where it is English speakers only. There is no specific one he needs to attend, only one that he expresses interest in. The reason for this is that Josue appears to express an ability to learn as he goes. This ability is something that we ought to encourage and foster. Second, I recommend that Josue and his father be given the opportunity for Josue to be placed in a regular class. Josue’s English ability, though obvious that he is not a native speaker, appears to be such that, according to our assessment, he is completely capable of handling an English speaker’s academic course. We have been able to verify he has no language or learning disabilities, so therefore it is upon the rest of his teachers to give him the opportunity to learn at the same pace of his regular English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Describe the Types of Characteristics That Lead to a Professional Diagnosis&lt;br /&gt;
Although there are signs that are visible to professionals when attempting to diagnose cerebral palsy, not all of these signs are visible at birth, rather becoming more obvious as development progresses. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) And because cerebral palsy, or hereafter referred to as CP, ranges in severity of disorder – often times there is instead a spectrum of conditions in the diagnosis of CP. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Children are usually generally screened at 9, 18, and 24 months. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) Pediatricians usually watch for delays in motor function relating to the child’s ability to hold his or her head up, rolling over, visual alertness, sitting, crawling, walking, and picking up small objects. (Cerebral Palsy Guide, 2018) The pediatrician may check for signs such as if the baby has low muscle tone (the baby feels floppy), the baby being unable to hold up his or her own head when lying stomach down or in a supported sitting position (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), muscle spasms or feeling stiff (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), poor muscle control as well as reflexes as posture (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), delayed development relating to motor functions (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), issues with feeding or swallowing (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018), and the preference to use one side of the body. Cerebral palsy is not a progressive disorder meaning that the disorder does not becoming worse over time. (Nordqvist, 2017) Rather, quality of life can improve once treatment through therapy is applied. (Nordqvist, 2017) Often times these babies are born on time instead of being born prematurely. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) So time varies for when an infant is diagnosed with CP. However, a “General Movements Assessment can be conducted from birth until 5 months of age.” (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, 2018) This assessment can indicate whether or not a child as CP but it cannot indicate the severity of CP.&lt;br /&gt;
Discuss the Stages of Development in Which These Characteristics Emerge&lt;br /&gt;
Because CP is not a progressive disorder and does not worsen over time as children reach adulthood, there is no stage of development. (Nordqvist, 2017) However, as mentioned earlier, these stages of development may appear to worsen as a child with mild CP may have delayed developmental milestones, which would to a parent, appear to be in some sort of way progressive. So rather than the disorder developing over a period of time, it is the appearance of the disorders that becomes more visible as the child reaches what should be normal developmental milestones that a parent begins to suspect something is wrong if the severity of the disorder is not great. So, children with varying conditions may reach certain developmental milestones with the use of therapy and interventions, (Loop, 2016) or they may never reach certain milestones at all, if the depth of damage to the brain is great. (Loop, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
Provide an analysis and comparison of at least 4 current intervention practices related to this disability&lt;br /&gt;
First, a point should be made about the spectrum of conditions that CP affects in people. CP has many different conditions and affects every person differently. Though the definition of cerebral palsy is clear, which is that it is “a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damaged that occurs to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth”, the symptoms and depth of damage varies greatly. And in many cases, the depth exact trigger is unknown. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some affected with CP are able to walk while some are unable to walk. The same applies for cognitive ability. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) Some with CP are affected with blindness, deafness, and epilepsy. (Mayo Clinic, 2016) So this makes treatment and intervention of this disorder to be varied greatly and highly dependent on an individual case. Here I will describe four examples of therapy but it should be noted that these methods once again are dependent on a case by case basis.&lt;br /&gt;
First is physical therapy. Physical therapy focuses on the motor functions of the child and seeks to improve specific abilities which could include “the child’s posture, sensory processing, muscle tone, and coordination, developmental skills, and adaptive equipment.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) Because one of the many symptoms of CP affects the body’s ability to control motor function, physical therapy looks to improve the motor function through strength training and muscle development through resistance training. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Physical therapy also can involve providing for the child a stroller, a wheelchair, and even car seats. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Coordination is also sought to be improved upon, since CP affects the muscle’s ability to function correctly.&lt;br /&gt;
The second intervention and therapy method is occupational therapy. While physical therapy seeks to improve the motor function and physical aspects of a person with CP, occupational therapy focuses on “the whole being” (CP Daily Living, 2016) so that a person with CP can live a fulfilling life to the best of their abilities. For example, basic tools like being able to feed oneself and the ability to use scissors are instead replaced with the help of an occupational therapist with specialized feeding utensils and adaptive scissors. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Both physical therapy and occupational therapy are similar in that they both first conduct an evaluation to determine the potential of ability in the person. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Based on this comprehensive evaluation, occupational and physical therapists then provide targeted training to further develop a person with CP. They are both similar in that while sometimes occupation and physical therapy can be an intensive method, they are usually designed to be fun and stimulating for the child.&lt;br /&gt;
The third method is constraint induced movement therapy, or CIMT. CIMT deals with individuals that have impairment on one side of the body that is greater than the other. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Often times these individuals learn “non-use” of their more impaired limb because they neglect that limb in favor of the more functional limb. (CP Daily Living, 2016) So CIMT seeks to improve “the activity level and usage of the impaired limb.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This therapy was first developed in the early 1900s with the use of experiments of monkeys. It was used in the 1960’s with stroke patients. But only recently with the advancement in the theories of brain plasticity has CIMT become a much more influential tool in the use of individuals with CP and others, like stroke victims. (CP Daily Living, 2016) The potential negative to CIMT is that whereas CIMT focuses on the use of the single, more impaired limb, bimanual training focuses on the use of both limbs in coordination together with the theory that because the brain uses both sides of the brain’s hemisphere to move limbs, potentially using only one limb to train the brain may lose ability to inhibit one side of the brain and prohibit new connections from forming on the uninjured side. (CP Daily Living, 2016) While studies have found that both bimanual training and CIMT have produced statistically significant improvements in the use of the limbs of patients with CP, the downside of this therapy is that it is intensive on both the child and the parent. (CP Daily Living, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
The fourth method is speech-language therapy. Because the spectrum of severity of CP is wide and varied, often times along with motor function disabilities a person with CP could also be affected with speech disabilities. Speech-language therapy, or SLP, evaluates “communication skills” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and treats “speech and language disorders” (CP Daily Living, 2016) and includes “receptive and expressive language, auditory processing, memory, articulation, and phonological training.” (CP Daily Living, 2016) This method focuses on those with articulation disorders, fluency disorders, resonance or voice disorders, or dysphagia or oral feeding disorders. (CP Daily Living, 2016) Sometimes the use of computers aids in the therapy, or, if the disorder is severe and the patient is unable to speak completely, different means of communications may be developed, like the use of sign language or the use of voice output communication devices. (CP Daily Living, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
Summarize at least 2 educational theories that can be applied to the improvement of special education in the context of your selected disability&lt;br /&gt;
Personalization is the educational theory of “tailoring services to meet the unique goals and aspirations of a child and that of a child’s family so that the child can reach his or her full potential.” (Patten, 2018) Specifically, personalization of the classroom environment is important for those with CP because CP is a wide and varied disorder. The needs of each child are different. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) So with those with CP, there will need to be a wide variety of accommodations to be made so that the classroom is personalized in a manner that allows the child with CP to reach his or her goals. Examples of this include making sure there is enough space in the classroom to ensure the child with CP can get around the classroom. (Cerebral Palsy Guidance, 2018) Because the child with CP may not be cognitively inhibited, though outwardly he or she may look disabled, the cognitive processes are somewhat normal. This means that the child is still a child. He or she may want to be involved in the process making friends, being included in the classroom, and being involving in the various activities that revolve around the classroom. As such, teachers can be involved in the personalization process by making sure that the student with CP can receive enough opportunities to stimulate his or her mind as much as a student without any disabilities would receive. The second theory is the theory of inclusion, which is the “idea of education students both with and without disabilities together within classes at local schools.” (Patten, 2018) This idea is critical to those that suffer with CP and like mentioned earlier, may not actually be cognitively disabled as he or she is physically disabled. Inclusion can help the child feel and to know he or she is making progress in his or her life through the use of integration of the disabled student and those without disabilities. Teachers could in this manner expose students to awareness about CP and even foster new types of friendships with the child with CP disability.&lt;br /&gt;
Outline the history and laws specific to the disability&lt;br /&gt;
Cerebral palsy is as old as the Egyptians. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Though even the Greeks and Romans knew of cerebral palsy, like us now, they did not know how to cure it. In the 1830’s, a surgeon named William John Little made headway into the study of cerebral palsy. It was at this time not known as cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1853, Little published a study titled “On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In it, he wrote a description of cerebral palsy with the name of “pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy”. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1861, Little attempted to define cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) At this time the disorder was known as Little’s Disease. What’s important to note here is that Little wrote about “the importance of early treatment and intervention.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Furthermore, he wrote about how “the children have been “restored to considerable activity and enjoyment of life.”” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1889, Sir William Osler wrote a book titled “Cerebral Palsies of Children.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1897 Sigmund Freud proposed that cerebral palsy was a disorder that formed before childbirth. This view contrasted with Sir William Osler and William John Little. Furthermore, Freud also associated “intellectual disabilities, visual disturbances, and seizures with cerebral palsy.” (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1949 the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation is founded. Leonard Goldenson and his wife Isabelle along with Jack Hausman and his wife Ethel founded the organization because both couples were parents to children with cerebral palsy. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1963 President John F. Kennedy signs the Community Mental Health Act. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) Around the 1980’s, research is proven to the credit of Sigmund Freud in that cerebral palsy is formed before birth. (Birth Injury Guide, 2018) In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is passed, forbidding employers from discriminating those with disabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
The Learning Environment&lt;br /&gt;
I envision working with ages that relate to grades 1-5 which is traditionally known as elementary school. In this environment, there is an inclusive environment of both disabled and nondisabled children. It is a public school, so I must not only learn to work with my student, who has cerebral palsy, as a special needs teacher, but also to work with the main teacher in the classroom. The first strategy I would employ would be to work with the main teacher in providing ways to create an inclusive environment concerning the curriculum of the classroom. In a classroom of more than 25 students, it is understandable that the children without disabilities would take priority in terms of course curriculum preference. However, I would attempt to design ways to inject material into the main course curriculum that would provide for in terms of inclusion for my student who has cerebral palsy. Second, I would seek the advice of the main teacher as well as the other special needs teacher in order to get better insight into the overall program of not only just my student but also the students of the entire school. I would seek the council of the other more experienced teachers in order to better serve the needs of my special needs student. Third, I would also request from the main teacher an opportunity to make small adjustments in the classroom which would enable my student with CP to be better equipped to move around in the classroom, as my student could likely be wheel chair bound. Fourth and finally, I would also maintain close contact with my student’s other therapists and interventionists in order to fully maintain optimal progress with his or her own levels of achievement outside of the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
March of Dimes is an organization that seeks to raise awareness of CP. Not only can you find information related to CP on the website, but you can also attend events related to your zip code that will put you in contact with other advocates and those who have friends or family members that are diagnosed with CP. Having a support group is incredibly important for those members that have CP and members that are related to those with CP. March of Dimes is a large organization that aggregates information of events related to CP. Finding closer friends and new family members to help support my student would only be a zip code entry away. Second, I would recommend looking into the professionals that reside in my student’s local area that specializes in CP. A quick search through Google reveals that in this hypothetical situation, my student lives in Galveston, Texas and there is a local doctor that specializes in CP. His name is David A. Yngve, MD. Being able to know who the professionals are, medically, will be of major assistance to my student because there are things that are constantly developing in the field of medicine and someone like Doctor Yngve could point my student to a new direction concerning therapy and intervention. Furthermore, mothers and fathers could keep in touch with Doctor Yngve and he could also provide further information for coping and raising a child with CP such as my student. A service I would not recommend is, according to my student’s local area, is the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children in Galveston Texas. Because I have a belief in inclusion of students with disabilities into a regular classroom with students that have no disabilities, I believe that segregating a student with CP with other students that have CP is, though I’m sure he or she would receive more specialized training, of no benefit to not only my student that has a special need, but also to the students without CP. My student would be a beacon of awareness to the other students without a disability. And my view is that because there are so many options and potentials, perhaps one of my students without a disability will one day grow up to become a doctor that would specialize in CP. And perhaps my student that has CP would also one day grow up to be a doctor that specializes in CP. But because I view that inclusion is of the highest priority in students with disabilities, I would recommend against sending my student with CP to the Moody State School for Cerebral Palsied Children.&lt;br /&gt;
In my ideal schedule I would have my student with CP to have a separate, more focused learning classroom that gives me one on one time with him or her. Here I am focusing on building skills relating to his or her specific disabilities and am working around or building up on those disabilities. So, from the start of the school day, from 8 until 9:45, I have my own alone time with my student. Furthermore, I am also teaching the same curriculum that my coworker, the main teacher that focuses on the children without the disabilities, has planned with me together from weeks previously. And then from 10:00 to 11:30, my student spends the rest of his or her time with the rest of the class. I have already coordinated with my other coworker, the main teacher that teaches the children without CP and the bulk of the information that needs to be taught on an normal pace is already taught, and from 10:00 to 11:30PM the main teacher focuses on inclusion of my special needs student into the regular classroom schedule. Once lunch begins at 11:30 and ends at 12:30, it is then that we return to the main classroom in an inclusive environment with the other students, until 2:30, which is 30 minutes before school ends. My special needs student and I depart from the classroom earlier in order to avoid the rush of the students leaving because my special needs student with CP could have a physical disability which could slow down the other students or even potentially injure him or herself from the other students rushing out of the classroom. Because the classroom is spaced out in such a manner that my student, who could be in a wheel chair, can easily leave the classroom without much of a distraction, the other students are not very much aware of myself and my special needs student departing.&lt;br /&gt;
My special needs student, who could be anywhere from ages 5-12 will be experiencing what is known as the Industry vs. Inferiority stage of Erik Erikson. In this stage teachers become more important as do the peers of the child. (Mcleod, 2013) Children begin to feel a sense of accomplishment in their competencies. (Mcleod, 2013) My special needs student may have major limitations which may inhibit this part of the development. This is why I will focus on developing his or her ability to write, if he or she cannot speak fluently due to a lack of motor control, so that he or she can begin to feel that they can express themselves freely, if not by their mouths but by their minds. Second, I will focus on developing a specific curriculum that emphasizes something physical. So that no matter his or her physical limitations, some sense of autonomy can be achieved through little exercises, dependent upon her or her limitations. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) Third, I would focus on building the students idea of self-image. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) At this age that self-image can be shaky, even in a normally developing child. I would work on finding ways to build an alternative self-image, specifically through the use of a blog and social media, where a student can be a different person in a limitless universe that is the internet. Of course, this would be with the parent’s permission. Finally, I would always speak on eye level with my student if he or she were in a wheel chair to promote a sense of equal footing with myself and my student. (Special Education Support Service, 2018) All activities would be performed on this level.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, it could be that my student is not originally an English speaker. I would provide for a translator for when I need to speak with his or her parents and to also attempt to learn basic commands and praises in that language so that some sense of communication occurs in a meaningful way. It could be that this student not only is involved in my special needs class but also an English as a Second Language course in which he or she is learning English as well as attempting to perform in a regular English speaking classroom, so not only would I attempt to learn basic language skills of that student’s proficiency but to also coordinate with the ESL teacher in order to better improve and progress their skills to perform adequately.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a case study of the infants and toddlers of Newberry Child Care Center. Newberry Child Care Center is located in Newberry, South Carolina. This center provides for infants and toddlers ages 6 weeks to 12 years old. Mrs. Harker is the primary caregiver. Ms. Johnson is the assistant. I will be identifying principles of development between the children as well as identifying potential “at risk behaviors” that could be related to developmental disabilities. I will also be identifying ways in which the caretakers can foster trust and autonomy in the infants and toddlers. Finally, I will be identifying potential opportunities in which the families, caretakers, centers, schools, and communities can affect the development of the infants and toddlers at the Newberry Child Care Center. The first principle of early development is Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development. Erikson believed that children develop in a series of stages. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) In each of these stages of development, Erikson proposed that the child has a conflict in which a trait, or “virtue” is either developed or underdeveloped. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) This view of personality growth was predicated on the proposal that each stage of development was built in a predetermined order building upon one another. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) Because this essay focuses on the development of children, specifically infants and toddlers, I will only be covering the first four stages of Erikson’s psychosocial development. These four stages of development according to Erikson are: the trust vs. mistrust stage, the autonomy vs. shame and doubt stage, the initiative vs. guilt stage, and the industry vs. inferiority stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trust vs. mistrust stage the attachment that the infant has with his or her caretaker is the basis upon which this stage develops the virtue of hope. The infant is unsure of the world and feels the need to be comforted and to know the baby can be taken care of. (Mcleod, 2018) If properly and consistently taken care of, the infant learns hope. If the infant receives inconsistent care and neglect, the baby instead learns fear, which leads to “anxiety, heightened insecurities, and an over feeling of mistrust in the world around them.” (Mcleod, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
In the autonomy vs. shame and doubt stage, infants become toddlers and are now walking or crawling on their own initiative. Toddlers strive to be autonomous. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) Toddlers are now learning that they can complete simple tasks on their own. (Mcleod, 2018) When properly developed by helping the toddler to develop self-esteem by helping him or her to make his or her own choices, parents can help the child develop the virtue of will. Failure to properly attain the virtue leads to a lack of self-esteem. (Mcleod, 2018) Furthermore, a toddler that is not given the opportunity to become autonomous can lead to a toddler becoming overly dependent upon others and to feel shame and doubt. (Mcleod, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
In the initiative vs. guilt stage, children are now learning to direct power and control to their environments. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) This can happen through play and social interaction. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) Children are now regularly engaging in other children through play. (Mcleod, 2018) Through this play children are developing themselves to believe that they can lead others and to take initiative. (Mcleod, 2018) If children develop and overcome this stage of obstacles, they develop the virtue of purpose. (Mcleod, 2018) If the obstacles are not overcome, children begin to feel guilty at “being a nuisance”. (Mcleod, 2018) Some guilt however is necessary for self-control and the development of the conscience. (Mcleod, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
In the industry vs. inferiority stage, children do things on their own and can even solve simple mathematics. (Mcleod, 2018) Children now feel the need to win approval of his or her peers. Their self-confidence is developed through the approval of their peers and parents and teachers. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) Continuing, children can learn that they can be industrious by the completion of goals. (Mcleod, 2018) The resulting virtue from the conquering of the obstacles of the child’s life is now competence. (Mcleod, 2018) The child that cannot overcome his or her obstacles becomes feeling inferior and doubtful of his or her own abilities. (Mcleod, 2018) Kara is one year old. She is learning to use a spoon to eat. She develops autonomy and the virtue of will when she is allowed to try many times to eat with her spoon. Although she has not yet mastered the ability to eat with a spoon, she is given an opportunity to learn and is not spoon-fed by her mother.&lt;br /&gt;
The second developmental principle is Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. According to Piaget, “actions prompt though processes, which influence the actions the next time around.” (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) His theory proposed that schemas are the building blocks of thought processes by which people act and navigate through their worlds. (Mcleod, 2007) These schemas can be known as models of the world. (Mcleod, 2007) These schemas are constantly changing depending upon each action and influence in the environment. (Mcleod, 2007) Piaget’s theory was that infants and toddlers develop in four stages of cognitive development. Those four stages are the sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2), the pre-operational stage (age 2 to age 7), the concrete operational stage (age 7 to 11), and the formal operational stage (age 11 to adolescence and adulthood). (Mcleod, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
For the sensorimotor stage, what is the most important milestone of development is object permanence, which is, the ability to understand that an object that is hidden can still exist. (Mcleod, 2007) In the preoperational stage, children are still egocentric and have the inability to take the viewpoint of others. Furthermore, children can now think symbolically, (Mcleod, 2007) which sometimes manifests in the form of playing by pretending. In the concrete operational stage, children can now think logically. (Mcleod, 2007) They now understand the concept of conversation, which is the ability to see different shapes and volumes and understanding that they can have the same quantity. (Mcleod, 2007) Finally, the formal operational stage is the stage which lasts until adulthood. (Mcleod, 2007) Children can learn to think in abstract concepts and test a hypothesis. (Mcleod, 2007) Kara has no trouble finding objects that Mrs. Harker hides. She has obviously developed the concept of object permanence.&lt;br /&gt;
The third principle of development is Bowlby’s attachment theory. His theory was that “mental health and behavioral problems could be attributed to early childhood.” (Mcleod, 2018) He was the first to introduce this theory. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) His belief was that the role of the primary caregiver and or parent influences the infant to adulthood and the importance of the attachment of the child to the mother and or caregiver. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) This view was that such an attachment process was inborn in the child, or biological, because it ensures the survival of the child. (Mcleod, 2018) This biologically evolved process developed not only just the infant but also with the mother as well. (Mcleod, 2018) In this view, the relationship of the mother is completely different from the relationships of others in the infant. (Mcleod, 2018) According to Bowlby, the child that lacks the secure attachment results in the long-term consequence of delinquency, reduced intelligence, increased aggression, depression, and affectionless psychopathy. (Mcleod, 2018) Lane may be experiencing an insecure attachment from his mother because he ccries for some time when his parents leave. He is also quiet and observant of others, perhaps from the fear that has been developing from such an insecure attachment. He even cries when he sees his mother. Furthermore, rattles and rings by Mrs. Harker seem to startle Lane.&lt;br /&gt;
Infants have developmental milestones. This does not mean that such milestones are completely concrete in regards to when they happen, but it instead serves as a guideline for parents and caregivers to follow. When the child is born to two months, the baby is “pre-reaching”, that is, reaching his or her hand to grasp at something but being unable to grab at it. (Oswalt, 2018) Joey, who is probably less than two months old, has this pre-reaching ability but does not have the ability to grasp at the objects he reaches for. (Oswalt, 2018) This is partly due to the lack of clarity in vision, as babies in this stage are only able to see 8-12 inches from their face. When the baby is three or four months, the baby is able to hold objects in an “ulnar grasp”. (Oswalt, 2018) By five months, baby is able to switch objects from one hand to another. (Oswalt, 2018) By six months the ability is refined. (Oswalt, 2018) Around 7-9 months a baby should be able to pick up a cup and drink from it. (Oswalt, 2018) By 9 months a baby has developed the pincer grasp. (Oswalt, 2018) By 12 months, babies can use their hands independently of each other. This unlocks the ability to use tools. (Oswalt, 2018) Kara, who is 1 year old, can now throw objects and toys. Her walking and running is improved, but still not finished with the toddler stage. Kara likely toddles when walking and running. She is also banging toys together. She can use her hands independently of each other. Yet the ability to use with her hands tools is not completely refined. She has attempted to eat with a spoon but instead chooses to eat with her hands and fingers. By 15 months, a baby can use tools like spoons, cups and crayons. (Oswalt, 2018) They can now also open cabinets. (Oswalt, 2018) By the time the baby becomes a toddler, he or she can draw lines and circles. Lucy, who is 18 months old, is officially a toddler. Lucy can play with toys and enjoys doing things on her own. She likes to dress the doll and build a road on her own. She makes this known when she says “no, me.” Lucy has the ability to perform refined skills like pouring a drink into a cup. Although it is not perfect, as she has tipped over the cup the first time, she can learn to perform this function when she is shown the proper way to do it. Because they are understanding autonomy, they like to see the cause and effect of their actions. Bobby has knocked down Lucy’s block tower. He has also done this to his own tower. By 21 months baby can undress themselves. (Oswalt, 2018) By 24 months the now toddler can unwrap presents or solve simple puzzles. (Oswalt, 2018) Jolie is 2 years old and enjoys solving complex puzzles if she can be encouraged to complete them. She can color and draw but with the use of a fisted grip.&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere between the ages of 2-3, a child no longer “toddles”. (Oswalt, 2018) Their walk and run has become smoother. They can now also jump and hop. Children at this stage can now scribble and fit objects into matching holes. (Oswalt, 2018) You should be able to now see a preference for one hand over the other. (Oswalt, 2018) 3-4 year olds can steer a tricycle. Zippers are now able to be manipulated and babies can now use scissors to cut paper. (Oswalt, 2018) The twisting motion used to open doors is now viable, and they can now use larger writing instruments, like a fat crayon. (Oswalt, 2018) By 4-5 a child can navigate up and down the stairs. (Oswalt, 2018) The ability to unbutton and button is achieved. (Oswalt, 2018) Simple stick figures can be drawn. (Oswalt, 2018) From 5-6 they start to “jump rope, skate, hitting balls with bats and so on.” (Oswalt, 2018) Further fine motor skills are developed. A child at this stage can dress and undress him or herself completely and are able to use writing utensils with more control. (Oswalt, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Lane is 8 months old. Lane has a few signs that may convey a developmental delay. First, Lane cries for some time when he is dropped off at the child care center. He needs to be held and comforted until his parents leave. When the parents of other children come through to drop off their children, Lane cries again and looks to Mrs. Harker for comfort. Lane is a selective eater, with his mother saying that lane is “a fussy eater”. Furthermore, Lane is easily distracted. When a rattle or a bell of a toy is initiated by Mrs. Harker, while Madison enjoys the sound, Lane is startled and begins to fuss unless distracted. Lane is quiet and observant of others. Lane sits with Mrs. Harker when she reads to the children. He is easily distracted by the other children. When Lane’s parents arrive he again cries. Lane may be exhibiting signs of a developmental delay due to an insecure attachment from his mother. (Mcleod, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Bobby is 18 months old. He is always on the move. He does not stay on a task for very long. An adult must sit next to him in order to keep him seated. His hand must be held by an adult otherwise he would hurt himself. He sometimes displays aggressive behavior, which can be seen in kicking down Lucy’s building block tower. He talks to fish and has an unusual focus on animals instead of people. This is part of a behavioral warning sign that has to do with the inability to pay attention or stay focused as long as the other children. (“How A Child Develops – Development Delay,” 2018) He has a focus on unusual objects for long periods of time. (“How A Child Develops – Development Delay,” 2018) He appears to enjoy this more than interacting with others. (“How A Child Develops – Development Delay,” 2018) He expresses aggressive behavior and appears stubborn compared to the other children. (“How A Child Develops – Development Delay,” 2018) He may express a form of autism. Autism screening is suggested.&lt;br /&gt;
Lucy is 18 months old. She expresses some stubborn behavior when offered help to build a road or dress a doll. She sometimes has been known to bite other children. She appears to show aggressive behavior, acting out, and showing stubbornness compared to the other children. (“How A Child Develops – Development Delay,” 2018) Furthermore, she does exhibit some signs of talking to herself when looking in the mirror, but no further information is given as to whether or not her behavior is more expressed than the other children. When she bites she is showing aggressive behavior which is a symptom of a behavioral warning sign.&lt;br /&gt;
Joey is an infant that is likely no older than 2 months old. This is evident from his pre-reaching abilities and his inability to grasp at objects in front of him. While he sleeps most of the day, when he is active Mrs. Harker gives Joey “tummy time”. This is giving Joey an opportunity to develop his neck muscles. Mrs. Harker also says to Joey “Come on Joey, do you want to eat?” by speaking to him he responds by cooing, which is the initial steps for his development of speech. When she feeds him a bottle, she gives Joey her finger for Joey to hold onto tightly, continuing to develop a secure attachment as Joey’s caregiver. All of these activities are encouraging Joey to develop his motor skills and to deepen the secure attachment that, according to John Bowlby, the infant needs to thrive. (Mcleod, 2018)&lt;br /&gt;
Kara is one year old and is quickly striving to become autonomous. Ms. Johnson asks Kara “Kara, would you like Rice Krispy’s or Cheerios?” that she might give Kara an opportunity to express autonomy. Toddlers like to be able to do things for themselves. This initiative by toddlers is encouraged so that the child gets as much practice as possible being able to exercise those choices. (“Helpful Tips – Toddler Behavior,” 2018) Ms. Johnson is allowing Kara to make her own decisions. Ms. Johnson also plays Kara’s favorite game, which is the guessing game. Ms. Johnson shows Kara a toy and asks Kara “What is it?” or “Who is it?” This is an opportunity to foster Kara’s growth in being able to relate abstract and concrete concepts.&lt;br /&gt;
Kara also has received a stuffed puppy for Kara’s first birthday. Mrs. Harker says to Kara, “Puppy, you like your puppy?” And Kara responds “Puppy”. Mrs. Harker is identifying for Kara what the category of the stuffed animal Kara has received is. Kara understands this and naturally says “puppy” in response to Mrs. Harker’s identification of the stuffed animal. Furthermore, Mrs. Harker helps to solidify Kara’s concept of object permanence, which is that Kara can understand that just because an object is not visible, does not mean it does not exist. Mrs. Harker places toys around for Kara to find and encourages this. This is where Piaget’s theory of cognitive development explains that Kara is moving onto the next stage of cognitive development, which is from the sensorimotor stage to the preoperational stage, which is symbolic thinking. (Mcleod, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;
Bobby has noticed Lucy’s construction. He sometimes has his “experiments” viewed as misbehavior. He has walked over to Lucy’s tower and knocked it over. Mrs. Hacker responded to Lucy’s crying and has said to Bobby, “Tell Lucy you are sorry. You made her cry. Help her to make her tower again.” Bobby has responded with “Sorry” and gives her a block before walking away. Bobby could represent a developmental issue and Mrs. Harker could benefit from an assessment of Bobby in order to better adapt Bobby to a goodness of fit environment in which Bobby could thrive. (Allard, &amp;amp; Hunter, 2010) Though, Bobby’s situation could merely be a result of a lack of proper channels of discipline and guidance. Instead of reprimanding Bobby, encourage some of his other behaviors in a form of four positive comments for every one reprimand. (“Helpful Tips – Toddler Behavior,” 2018) Has Bobby kicked down Lucy’s tower again? Then four more positive comments should be planned for Bobby in order to direct a reprimand for his behavior towards Lucy.&lt;br /&gt;
Lane’s temperament could be that of an active or feisty child. That is, Lane could be “fussy, irregular in feeding and sleeping habits, fearful of new people and situations, easily upset by noise and stimulation, and intense in their reactions.” (Allard, &amp;amp; Hunter, 2010) Mrs. Harker could benefit from the understanding of the temperament of children so that she does not blame herself or the child for reactions that are normal for the child. (Allard, &amp;amp; Hunter, 2010) It could be particular to Mrs. Harker’s case that the “goodness of fit” concept explains that there could be some form of a mismatch between Mrs. Harker’s curriculum and environment and Lane’s personality. (Allard, &amp;amp; Hunter, 2010) The dynamic between Mrs. Harker and Lane, and Lane’s own personal development could be improved with the adaptation of the understanding of Lane’s own temperament with Mrs. Harker’s modified environment and curriculum. (Allard, &amp;amp; Hunter, 2010)&lt;br /&gt;
Bobby likes to go to the Zoo. Actually, the Zoo survives off of grants from the state which is funded by tax payer subsidies. This is just one example of a community having a direct hand in the development of a child. If there were no Zoo, what opportunity would Bobby have to develop his obvious interest in animals? Mrs. Harker and her assistants like to take the children on strolls through the park. This park is also likely funded by tax paper subsidies. The community in which Mrs. Harker has her child care center directly benefits from this community sponsored place. Finally, Thomas, whose parents are Spanish speakers and lack the ability to speak English fluently, would never have arrived at the Newberry Child Care center if it were not for the many different opportunities for Pedro and Maria, Thomas’ parents, to work and to provide an income for Thomas and to pay for his child care services. If there were no such jobs for Pedro and Maria, Thomas would never have been able to have the opportunity to experience the excellent services of Newberry Child Care Center. The local job market has a direct impact on Thomas and his ability to receive services from Newberry Child Care Center.&lt;/p&gt;

(Scott is my imaginary boss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name: Kon Ham&lt;br /&gt;
Topic: Telecommuting Benefits&lt;br /&gt;
General Purpose: To Persuade&lt;br /&gt;
Specific Purpose: To persuade my boss to allow me to telecommute a few days a week and why it is beneficial to the company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Ideas:&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommuting attracts higher quality employees&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommuting increases quality of work of employees&lt;br /&gt;
Telecommuting saves companies money&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction: (Grabber) Why should an organization offer telecommuting to its employees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thesis Statement) Telecommuting offers a distinct advantage in that it attracts higher quality employees, increases productivity, and saves companies money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Preview) Good afternoon, Scott. I’ll be taking less than 7 minutes of your time to explain to you the numerous benefits of why I and our other colleagues ought to be telecommuting, and why having a telecommuting strategy available to employees is also beneficial to our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included three points that will be helpful to your decision making process. Each point should give you a clear idea of the advantages telecommuting offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Transition) First, telecommuting attracts higher quality employees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Point I: Telecommuting attracts higher quality employees&lt;br /&gt;
“A typical telecommuter is college-educated, 45 years old or older, and earns an annual salary of $58,000 while working for a company with more than 100 employees. 75% of employees who work from home earn over $65,000 per year, putting them in the upper 80th percentile of all employees, home or office-based.” (“Latest Telecommuting Statistics”, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average potential employee seeking telecommuting as an option for job flexibility tends to be college educated and older in age, as well as earnings in the 80th percentile of employee earnings, meaning they earn more than 80% of the general population. It can generally assumed that these people have the discipline to work from home as implied by the college degree in that it also takes discipline to graduate from college, as well as other advantages a college degree holder yields, such as time management and the ability to effectively communicate through writing as well as effective reading skills and internalized motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Commuting to work is a concern for many: Time savings has outranked cost savings as a factor in seeking flexible work for the past four years. That might be because 72 percent of today’s flexible job seekers reported having round-trip commutes over double the national average, which is approximately 50 minutes.” (Reynolds, 2016)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can overcome geographical barriers to potential employees by offering them flexibility in how they come into work. Most people want to save themselves time. Commuting is a major loss in time. We are at a disadvantage when we lose promising potential employees to other companies that offer benefits such as telecommuting as well as being in a closer area to the potential employee than we might be. Those who telecommute save money on gas, car maintenance as well as valuable time they could be spending elsewhere, and these people will take into consideration the time saved by being allowed to telecommute a few days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Transition) Second main point, the quality of work improves among those who telecommute.&lt;br /&gt;
Main Point II: Telecommuting increases quality of work of employees&lt;br /&gt;
“They feel compelled to go above and beyond to make their work presence more visible, to make themselves known as assets,” Gajendran said. “In fact, they almost overcompensate by being extra helpful, because they know in the back of their minds that their special arrangement could easily go away. So they give a little extra back to the organization.” (Ciciora, 2014)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Professor Ravi S. Gajendran’s research indicates that employees tend to feel indebted to the organization when telecommuting is offered as an alternative to working in the office. These people tend to report lower overall stress levels (Howington, 2016). These people are also half as likely to quit. (Hogan, 2015) This means that not only do we get to attract higher quality employees, but we also are more likely to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead, we found that people working from home completed 13.5% more calls than the staff in the office did—meaning that Ctrip got almost an extra workday a week out of them. They also quit at half the rate of people in the office—way beyond what we anticipated. And predictably, at-home workers reported much higher job satisfaction.” (Bloom, 2014)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researcher and Professor Nicholas Bloom working in conjunction with a James Liang, graduate student and cofounder of Ctrip, conducted an experiment in which employees volunteered to work from home. Their findings were that employees can be more productive at home, if given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workplace is not always the ideal place for individuals to work. Distraction from other employees as well as office politics and other stressors can be debilitating to the performance of our employees. Not only that, but consider days where inclement weather occurs or where an employee calls in sick. These lost days all add up to a loss in productivity of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Transition) Finally, the third point. The loss in productivity and the money saved from allowing employees to telecommute begins to add up significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Point III: Telecommuting saves companies money&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Bloom’s research and James Liang of Ctrip, it was estimated that an average of $1,900 per employee was saved for nine months. (Bloom, 2014)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredible amount of money that begins to add up over a long period of time. Consider the previous research finding in that telecommuters are half as likely to quit their jobs. The amount of money lost in “on-the-job training” begins to add up as well, as well as the amount of time lost in no longer having a productive employee to fill a needed position in the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
B. GlobalWorkPlaceAnalytics.com says&lt;br /&gt;
“If those with compatible jobs and a desire to work from home did so just half the time (roughly the national average for those who do so regularly) the national savings would total over $700 Billion a year including:&lt;br /&gt;
A typical business would save $11,000 per person per year&lt;br /&gt;
The telecommuters would save between $2,000 and $7,000 a year&lt;br /&gt;
The greenhouse gas reduction would be the “equivalent of taking the entire New York State workforce permanently off the road.”&lt;br /&gt;
(Latest Telecommuting Statistics, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Transition) The cost of commuting is astronomical and the amount of money saved from telecommuting is economical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: I hope that I’ve made clear to you the distinct advantages both short term and long term that telecommuting offers. I’ve made this presentation for you so that you could consider the telecommuting advantage for myself as well as my other colleagues that ask for the opportunity to increase productivity, the opportunity to save myself, my colleagues and our organization countless amounts of money, as well as being a part of a happier, more pleasant work environment, both from the office and at home.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CIS101 Computer Literacy Final Project (Benefits of hypothetical printing company to switch to software as a service (SaaS) model)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/cis101-computer-literacy-final-project/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/cis101-computer-literacy-final-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;System Background and Functionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software as a service is a major function of larger companies who are looking towards the future of internet connectivity and increased efficiency between businesses and clients. Essentially, the majority of work usually done by sales representatives of Print-R-Us is moved to an online location in which customers can use an online software that allows for them to easily and quickly design media with near endless customizability to suit whatever needs a potential client has. This software is designed with the lay person in mind; to remember that the client may or may not know how to utilize a computer at their home or at a kiosk in the Print-R-Us storefronts. It is also designed with a “power-user” in mind; someone who may be a media professional that works with their own clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two immediate results include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, customers no longer need to translate ideas to a salesperson who, due to miscommunication or time constraints is unable to fully understand the client’s needs as to what or how a certain project a client wishes the appearance, functionality and use ought to be and instead can utilize easy to use software and related kiosks (which will also run the same software hosted on the internet) to fully meet all needs of the client. This is accomplished through the use of software as a service hosted on the internet. (SaaS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, financial transactions will stay the same in the store front. Print-R-Us will continue to charge for material and printing but instead will be able to pass on cost cutting savings onto the customer by freeing up sales personnel to instead provide a fulfilling sales environment and two, quicker financial processing for orders on the store front side.&lt;br /&gt;
When customers utilize the software from their homes the financial transaction is processed through eCommerce software in which the transactions are processed through SSL, or secure socket layering encryption. This is an encryption process that is standard across most if not all industries in which sensitive information such as credit card information and names and addresses are passed through a web browser to a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major benefit to processing orders through an online service is that the service allows Print-R-Us to continue to do business even with store hour limitations. It takes little imagination as to see why this is a huge benefit for the total income of Print-R-Us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity in customer handling, financial transactions, and customer service can be exponentially increased in the following ways.&lt;br /&gt;
First, emphasis is made upon the customer handling and service because customer handling and service is the bottle neck to sales. The majority of customer sales representative will be moved first to kiosk usage and training. These customer sales representatives will instead be trained to encourage new customers and old customers to dream. These new representatives will focus instead on building the sales environment in which a customer is encouraged to design any and all media to unlimited potential. And because the majority of the building of the media project is handled by the customer, the sales representatives are now free to spend time floating from customer to customer to answer any basic graphical user interface questions as well as recommendations to certain kinds of media. It is at this point a customer sales representative can be allowed liberty to “up-sell” the client on premium materials as well as the branching out of new forms of media related to the project a customer has in mind when he or she walks into the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, wiki software is used to develop employees who were once sales representatives into “online service providers” in which these employees are paid a basic wage but are paid a premium for every customer question answered and in turn, the customer’s positive reviews of the answered question. These same employees will now be placed in charge of building wiki spaces in which basic questions are answered as well as providing examples of the creativity a customer can employ in the use of the software as a service (SaaS) that the kiosk or their own personal computer provides. The exercises these employees receive will allow them to move up and down the ladder from store-front sales representatives to being able to work as “online service providers”. Working either way allows these employees full perspective on the software and the service that Print-R-Us store fronts provide: legendary customer service, expert knowledge of craft, as well as expedient service (which the kiosks facilitate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, financial transactions will mostly remain the same. However, new additions will be made to the ability to make a transaction. Kiosks connected to the internet will give the customer the opportunity to pay through the kiosk instead of a sales representative. This kiosk will allow a customer to “suspend” a transaction to allow a sales representative to personally look through the order and should the customer wish, allow a sales representative to finalize the transaction him or herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information Privacy and Information Security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before making the final transition to cloud based storage of sensitive customer information, data will be stored in local store kiosks. If a customer needs to make a transition from one store to another, the information will first be placed onto an encrypted USB storage device that will only work at Print-R-Us kiosks as well as with a required 4-digit PIN number assigned by the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final transition of the software as a service selling environment will be with a 6 month beta-test period in which before sensitive data is placed into the cloud, the source code of the information will be posted online as well as a challenge to other hackers. The prize money for finding exploits will be $100 dollars per exploit. This will encourage outsiders with experience in unconventional exploitative methods to find vulnerabilities in the software. This fact of testing will be advertised to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though customers have the option to have the product delivered to their homes in a discrete package, some customers may choose to pick up their packages at Print-R-Us storefronts. Because privacy and informational security is now emphasized at Print-R-Us, sales representatives now deliver the final product to the consumer in a sealed envelope or package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, methods through email and sales representatives will be passed onto the customer in whom he or she can protect oneself from attacks. Print-R-Us will become a definitive authority on internet security and at this point can branch off into another way to increase sales transactions through the selling of security devices or related products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Ethical Issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, protection for the consumer – emphasize sales representatives do NOT look at the order creation process and only see the final cover page of the media. (Kiosks will include a cover page of the customer name and information that is covered media.)&lt;br /&gt;
Second, the problem may occur in which the client is producing material that is illegal or violates copyright issues. The sales representative is in such a position in which he or she does not see the material themselves but if the issue were to be presented to the sales representative, the policy on such issues need and must be clearly stated to the customer. That is, that Print-R-Us does NOT encourage the distribution of illegal material or the violation of copyright laws. This stance must be emphasized at all levels of the customer’s creative process that must remind the customer that while creativity is unlimited, boundaries are put in place to keep a client from violating upon the rights of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Print-R-Us must look toward the future. Employees will want to spend less of their time at store-fronts and more of their time either working at a job with a higher paying wage or working from home or going to school. Employees can find a solid foundation at Print-R-Us with the utilization of a schedule in which employees are allowed time to work from home as “online service providers” as well as being able to work at store fronts. When working from home Print-R-Us can pay lower wages and instead focus on the performance of an employee based on solid questions answered from clients. This keeps employees on two sides of the Print-R-Us model, both of which allow for the employees to be well crafted and knowledgeable in Print-R-Us values and goals. With less employees at store fronts afforded by the use of multiple kiosks, which the initial payoff of the machines pay off themselves quickly with the ability to have to use less employees at store fronts as well as being more effective in handling customer questions and concerns and faster transactions, the kiosks and software as a service as a positive step into the future becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With modern encryption and with the encouragement of hackers being paid off to work on exploits and vulnerabilities found in the source code of the online software, countless amount of dollars originally used to troubleshoot and maintain the software can instead be used to grow the company, branch into different businesses, or even provide a higher quality sales environment in which the customers walk into with each store front. The biggest issue with software as a service and cloud based storage arises with the potential for data breaches. This is why it is absolutely essential to find amateur and expert hackers alike who are already driven and passionate on this topic to find for us the problems which we may not see and may lie inherent in the software itself. The cost of paying $100 to a hacker per exploit can be much cheaper than hiring a network of software technicians and programmers to maintain the site. Instead, the online software should be corrected by the hackers themselves and the maintenance of the software to a small handful of employees who are either contracted out or trained from within the company to implement the improvements found by the hackers to further the software to higher potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With transferring the employees who normally would have lost their jobs as a result of a smaller workforce multiplied by the use of kiosks into a position of creating and maintaining a wiki of Print-R-Us, employees are given another chance to develop another skill which is marketable, productive, and well worth the hourly or salary wages Print-R-Us already pays its employees. Instead of paying an initial upfront cost of hiring or creating more software to provide answers and customer service to clients who are seeking more information on the software usage, these same employees who normally would have been laid off will now work to create the wiki page to answer all questions customers may have as well as premeditating potential questions or problems by creating articles an even creating examples of the potential of the online software Print-R-Us will utilize to allow customers to create their own projects without the use of sales representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the costs of creating a new future for Print-R-Us can be had for a low cost. The biggest cost will be in the purchase and creation of the software to be used online. But the initial pay will return dividends as a long term investment into a productive business model in which employees and customers alike are happy and fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

How does Soda Pop Organics, Inc., encourage future growth?&lt;br /&gt;
Soda Pop Organics, Inc., encourages future growth through the investment of small farms throughout developing countries. SPOI hopes to have over 150 international farms that grow organic sugar, fruit, and tea. In addition to this, SPOI has invested $2.5 million in a trademark branding approach to attract new investors and capital.&lt;br /&gt;
A concern regarding the investment throughout developing countries: Countries that are developing are not yet politically stable and can undergo regime change quickly. Depending on the amount of investment in each country, the money could be considered a loss if political instability or regime change occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
It is in these areas that infrastructure is still being developed so access to the farms and roads that can transport SPOI goods back and forth should be considered in each investment of the country and its likely or unlikely political instability.&lt;br /&gt;
Further recommendations include growing a base of customers within each developing country so that the each farm and developing plants are growing alongside the rising incomes of the various nations that SPOI wishes to develop as a part of its mission.&lt;br /&gt;
This means that drinks should include regional flavors that still maintain consistency with SPOI’s methods and outlook – i.e., organic.&lt;br /&gt;
Highly leveraged approaches to revenue may be considered unattractive to investors who are looking for consistencies throughout SPOIs mission and financial statement. It seems unlikely that SPOI would need an aggressive approach to leverage since the investment and development of small farms of developing countries would require time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>BUS220 Microeconomics Final Project (Netflix analysis and further suggestions. Relevant as of 20MAR20. I recommend and predict that Netflix will implement &amp;#8220;social viewings&amp;#8221; of movies in order to differentiate itself from other streaming services)</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/bus-220-microeconomics-final-project/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/bus-220-microeconomics-final-project</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Netflix is a company founded by Reed Hastings in 1999. The company originally&lt;br /&gt;
started with a mail-by-order DVD rental service. (“How Netflix got started”, 2009)&lt;br /&gt;
Although Netflix still provides this service, it is possibly most well known for delivering&lt;br /&gt;
entertainment content through the internet. This service is called “streaming” and&lt;br /&gt;
involves consumers being able to instantly view content with the ability to pause, rewind,&lt;br /&gt;
and fast forward video or audio. This streaming service is made possible with internet&lt;br /&gt;
access and differs from conventional television in that the user decides what program to&lt;br /&gt;
view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Netflix continues to provide DVD rental services as well as producing&lt;br /&gt;
new entertainment content to provide consumers, I have decided to choose this streaming&lt;br /&gt;
service as the point of research for this project because of the popularity of Netflix’s&lt;br /&gt;
streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the three determinants of demand for Netflix’s streaming&lt;br /&gt;
service: First, price of the subscription service. Netflix currently charges $9.99 for its HD&lt;br /&gt;
service and $7.99 for its regular service. One reason for price being a large determinant&lt;br /&gt;
of demand was the controversy of Netflix’s streaming service being raised $1.00. And as&lt;br /&gt;
a result of the second determinant of demand, consumer expectations, Netflix struggled&lt;br /&gt;
against consumer backlash with the increase of price. Although backlash was imminent,&lt;br /&gt;
so were the increases. But the increases in price don’t seem to have reduced the overall&lt;br /&gt;
number of subscriptions of customers. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016) Finally, the third&lt;br /&gt;
determinant of demand is consumer taste. Consumers tend to have preferences for the&lt;br /&gt;
shows they watch or types of genres they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitors of Netflix have capitalized&lt;br /&gt;
on this and have created streaming services to cater specifically to consumers who have&lt;br /&gt;
desires in specific niche markets, like, for example, Bloomberg’s streaming service&lt;br /&gt;
catered directly to those interested in business affairs. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016)&lt;br /&gt;
According to the previous determinants of demand, the streaming of service of&lt;br /&gt;
Netflix appears to be an inelastic demand. The number of subscribers has actually&lt;br /&gt;
increased despite the increase in price. (“The Impact Of Netflix’s”, 2014) And part of this&lt;br /&gt;
may have less to do with price and more to do with consumer expectations as well as&lt;br /&gt;
consumer taste. Netflix has been increasingly producing its own content as a result of the&lt;br /&gt;
higher prices content producers have been charging Netflix the rights to stream their&lt;br /&gt;
content on Netflix’s platform. And as a result of this, Netflix has been producing content&lt;br /&gt;
that has been exclusive to Netflix. Consumers now must decide if the exclusive content&lt;br /&gt;
on Netflix is worth the increase in monthly price. And of course, it appears to be that&lt;br /&gt;
consumers are happy with the content Netflix offers. And with the data collection that&lt;br /&gt;
Netflix obsessively hoards and analyzes, Netflix creates more exclusive shows that&lt;br /&gt;
appear to be irresistible to its monthly subscribers. (Bulygo, 2013) &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;572&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; src=&quot;http://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2305&quot; srcset=&quot;https://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.jpeg 572w, https://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-300x100.jpeg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px&quot; /&gt; &amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(“The Impact Of Netflix’s”, 2014) &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; src=&quot;http://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2306&quot; srcset=&quot;https://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.png 1024w, https://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-300x225.png 300w, https://konkham.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-768x576.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt; &amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Pelisson, 2017)&lt;br /&gt;
  The market structure of Netflix is most like a monopolistic competition. There are&lt;br /&gt;
many firms which sell a service, in this case streaming, and that service cannot easily be&lt;br /&gt;
differentiated between each firm. In this case, many of the movies and TV shows offered&lt;br /&gt;
on one firm’s service are also offered on another firm’s service. But because of this lack&lt;br /&gt;
of differentiation between the firms, these companies that offer streaming services now&lt;br /&gt;
offer exclusive content that is featured only on each of the company’s services. Although&lt;br /&gt;
the barriers to entry, in this case, consist of being in the millions of dollars, it is relatively&lt;br /&gt;
easy for production companies to create their own streaming service. Hulu, for example,&lt;br /&gt;
is a result of “a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company’s Disney/ABC TV&lt;br /&gt;
Group, Twenty-First Century Fox’s Fox Broadcasting Company and Comcast’s NBC&lt;br /&gt;
Universal Television Group”. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016) In this case here, the&lt;br /&gt;
strategic alliance between these companies makes the creation of a streaming service and&lt;br /&gt;
company a relatively low-cost option. (“Analyzing Netflix’s”, 2016)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And interestingly enough, Netflix draws from its massive source of analytics and&lt;br /&gt;
data to create targeted advertisements to draw audiences into its original content shows.&lt;br /&gt;
(Katai, 2017) This means that theoretically, it can draw in audiences into shows they&lt;br /&gt;
would not originally have interest in, if the targeted advertisements could create a draw&lt;br /&gt;
based upon the targeted person’s preference in sex, age, and interests.&lt;br /&gt;
Netflix is slowly moving away from the monopolistic competition market&lt;br /&gt;
structure due to the fact that Netflix is continually expanding its creation of original&lt;br /&gt;
content. Had Netflix continued only to offer a streaming service as its sole source of&lt;br /&gt;
revenue, competitors would have cut Netflix out of the market by creating its own direct&lt;br /&gt;
streaming service. And furthermore, consumers would have a harder time differentiating&lt;br /&gt;
between the firms and the services. But because Netflix produces exclusive content,&lt;br /&gt;
consumers have an easier time differentiating between the firms but possibly a more&lt;br /&gt;
difficult time choosing between the firms as a result of conflict of interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three recommendations I would make to Netflix are this: First, while&lt;br /&gt;
continuing to produce original content, increase the prices again. Offer excellent content&lt;br /&gt;
and services in return for the higher price to justify to consumers that Netflix remains the&lt;br /&gt;
undisputed champion in streaming services and content creation. And as Netflix&lt;br /&gt;
continues down this direction, Netflix should move from streaming service as the&lt;br /&gt;
delivery method and to focus entirely on content creation as the means to differentiate&lt;br /&gt;
itself from its competitors. I justify this suggestion based upon the graph I’ve created&lt;br /&gt;
above that suggests the price of Netflix is to a certain degree, inelastic. The recent price&lt;br /&gt;
increases of Netflix, while vocally many consumers groaned against this increase, still&lt;br /&gt;
did not cause enough of Netflix’s consumers to cancel their monthly subscription. And I&lt;br /&gt;
believe this is a result of Netflix’s continuation to create original content. This content is&lt;br /&gt;
exclusive to Netflix and cannot be streamed on other streaming platforms like Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Netflix wanted additional revenue, I would also suggest the creation of&lt;br /&gt;
supplementary products. One example would be the implementation of a social network&lt;br /&gt;
interface to Netflix’s streaming service. In this service Netflix would allow for their&lt;br /&gt;
customers to connect with each other – to share, to “like”, and to use Netflix as a medium&lt;br /&gt;
to meet new people. This would be a totally unique service that would set Netflix apart&lt;br /&gt;
completely. This is a great way to enter into alternative markets to take from people who&lt;br /&gt;
would not ordinarily use Netflix for social media. And considering that Netflix is&lt;br /&gt;
sometimes broadcasted on a TV, Netflix could also introduce a proprietary keyboard that&lt;br /&gt;
works as a remote as well as a microphone device. There is not a platform that allows this&lt;br /&gt;
service. It would take little investment to create a social-media element to this and would&lt;br /&gt;
justify the higher cost of Netflix. There are many people in relationships that are&lt;br /&gt;
currently separated due to job relocations and so on. Giving opportunities for couples to&lt;br /&gt;
watch movies together and to communicate while the movie goes on gives Netflix the&lt;br /&gt;
opportunity to offer emotional and sentimental value to the consumer. This is priceless in&lt;br /&gt;
itself and customers would justify a $17.99 price if it meant that these consumers could&lt;br /&gt;
keep in touch with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while producing original content, I would suggest to Netflix to offer a&lt;br /&gt;
free subscription option to lure new customers into Netflix’s ecosystem. So this means&lt;br /&gt;
that Netflix negotiates with advertisers to pay for content distribution to consumers while&lt;br /&gt;
at the same time, Netflix continues to use the data analytics from the viewing habits of&lt;br /&gt;
consumers to target specific ads related to Netflix’s original content; from there to then&lt;br /&gt;
try to lure new consumers into purchasing Netflix’s “premium” access, which would be&lt;br /&gt;
anywhere from $15.99 to $17.99. I suggest this based off of not only price demand&lt;br /&gt;
determinant, but also tastes as a demand determinant. The higher price will most certainly&lt;br /&gt;
be unpopular since Netflix originally started at a $7.99 monthly subscription. Customers&lt;br /&gt;
have a luxury to compare that original price to my suggested new price: $15.99-17.99.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s around a 125% increase in price. So naturally there would be controversy. But I&lt;br /&gt;
believe that the creation of original content would change consumer demand would not&lt;br /&gt;
change the consumer demand but would rather shift the entire demand curve to the right.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to further finance these costs, I also suggest strategic alliances with&lt;br /&gt;
production companies, especially newer production companies that are willing and&lt;br /&gt;
desperate to breakthrough into the market. So, signing new production companies into a&lt;br /&gt;
contract in which Netflix offers to stream the content in exchange for ad revenue and data&lt;br /&gt;
collection from the streaming of the new production companies’ content. Streaming on&lt;br /&gt;
the Netflix platform is sure to generate viewership so it works out for new production&lt;br /&gt;
companies. Since Netflix is giving free traffic to these production companies, it costs&lt;br /&gt;
Netflix only the bandwidth cost. That cost is offset by the revenue of the advertisements&lt;br /&gt;
that will play on top of these breakthrough shows. And Netflix can create further assets&lt;br /&gt;
through the data and analytics that are mined from the result of viewership that comes&lt;br /&gt;
from the “free subscription” of Netflix. So it is a win-win situation for everyone,&lt;br /&gt;
especially for those who feel they’ve not the ability to justify paying $17.99 in&lt;br /&gt;
subscription costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the free subscription is a matter of maintain strategic alliances between the&lt;br /&gt;
production companies who don’t have the revenue to create their own streaming services&lt;br /&gt;
and the advertising companies as well as the scouting of new production companies who&lt;br /&gt;
are willing to sacrifice current revenue for viewership now. This can be an avenue for&lt;br /&gt;
countless amounts of “indie” or independent content creators to find a wider viewership.&lt;br /&gt;
This even means that these people no longer have to upload their content through&lt;br /&gt;
YouTube and instead Netflix can take a portion of YouTube’s production community&lt;br /&gt;
away from it and drive it instead to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to correctly predict future consumer tastes and preferences all of&lt;br /&gt;
the time. That’s why investing in future production companies who are independent and&lt;br /&gt;
usually don’t have the cash flow to create their own content streaming service would be&lt;br /&gt;
beneficial to Netflix. Netflix can then take this data from the viewership of these smaller&lt;br /&gt;
production companies and then turn around and create its own original content that can&lt;br /&gt;
compete with these independent content creators. And with the higher cost of&lt;br /&gt;
subscription, Netflix can then focus entirely on creating original content. Netflix must&lt;br /&gt;
focs on content creation as a result of larger production companies like Disney, ABC and&lt;br /&gt;
so on creating their own streaming services. This means that they are not likely to share&lt;br /&gt;
content with Netflix, or will charge higher prices of access to Netflix because these large&lt;br /&gt;
production firms are in competition with Netflix. They want to succeed over Netflix so&lt;br /&gt;
there is no incentive for these companies to play along nicely with Netflix. If Netflix&lt;br /&gt;
were to simply sink back to streaming as a service as their only source of revenue, it will&lt;br /&gt;
fall into the monopolistic competition market structure and will eventually be forced out&lt;br /&gt;
of the industry by price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I suggest that Netflix not ignore the domestic market. There are still&lt;br /&gt;
millions more Americans who do not have Netflix subscription access as a result of the&lt;br /&gt;
technological divide. I suggest that Netflix create a device that plugs into a TV with&lt;br /&gt;
RGB, VGA, and HDMI inputs. This allows for people who do not have access to internet&lt;br /&gt;
streaming devices to plug into Netflix’s content environment. Now, since these people&lt;br /&gt;
usually are not tech-savvy it would take a mailing campaign with a personalized letter as&lt;br /&gt;
well as a detailed but simple “How-To” instructional on how to install the device and&lt;br /&gt;
how to pay for the service. Even better would be a way to provide access to content&lt;br /&gt;
without the use of internet – perhaps through a satellite connection. This same technology&lt;br /&gt;
could be used to gain entry into the market of consumers who are international but&lt;br /&gt;
without stable access to the internet. I believe that Netflix is expanding into the&lt;br /&gt;
international market and as a result under appreciating the domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ART220 Introduction to Film Final Project (Analysis of 'The Godfather')</title>
   <link href="https://getpoole.com/jfku%20final%20projects/2020/03/20/art_220-introduction-to-film-final-project/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are introduced to the Corleone family through a wedding. It is the wedding of Connie Corleone, daughter of Vito Corleone. Vito Corleone is the Don, or head executive of the Corleone crime family. Through the wedding we are introduced to multiple family characters and associates of the family. We also see people entering into the office of Don Vito Corleone to make requests of him. It is a Sicilian tradition to fulfill requests on the day of his daughter’s wedding. Here we see the dynamic of the power that Don Corleone wields. All requests are fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;
We are also introduced to Michael Corleone. He is the son of Don Corleone. Michael Corleone was returned from the wars of World War II. He is a war hero. Audience members are shown his reluctance towards the Corleone’s criminal interests. We also see that Michael Corleone is favored by Don Corleone. When the family gathers together for a photo, Don Corleone disperses the crowd upon seeing that Michael is not present for the photo.&lt;br /&gt;
We see various vices that the Corleone family members are involved in. Sonny has a temper problem and involves himself with other women besides his wife. Fredo Corleone was always weak and indecisive and a womanizer. We are also introduced to other family member associates, like Luca Brasi, an intimidating thug for the Corleone family, and Tom Hagen, an adopted German-Irish boy who grows up to be the lawyer and later consigliere for the Corleone family.&lt;br /&gt;
The inciting incident occurs when Don Corleone’s presence is requested by Sollozzo, a rising drug baron. Sollozzo requests support for his drug business but Don Corleone refuses because Don Corleone considers the drug business to be bad business. After the meeting finishes, Don Corleone orders Luca Brasi to spy on the Tattaglia family. Luca goes to the Tattaglia family and is killed. Around the same time, Don Corleone is also gunned down in the streets. These events are all part of the rising action of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;
The Climax of the movie occurs when Michael kills Sollozzo and McCluskey. This is because Sollozzo is still strong-arming the Corleone family, hoping to take advantage of the death of Luca and the hospitalization of Don Corleone. Sollozzo and McCluskey, a crooked police chief, meet Michael in order to broker the same deal that Corleone refused. Michael and the Corleone family use this opportunity to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey. At this point all of the crime families are at war. Michael is sent off to Sicily to hide until things begin to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;
Here in Sicily Michael lives a quiet life and even affords to marry a beautiful Sicilian woman named Apollonia. However he cannot hide for long. A car bomb intended for Michael Corleone ends up killing Apollonia. His brother, Sonny, is also killed by the crime families. Don Corleone, having healed now calls for a peace between the families. Don Corleone agrees to provide support for the heroin business and to look aside avenging the death of his son. Michael is able now to return home from Sicily.&lt;br /&gt;
Michael then takes the reigns of the Corleone family by becoming the Don. Vito Corleone, Michael’s father and the previous Don, steps aside and becomes the acting-consigliere. This is the falling action. Vito Corleone also suffers a fatal heart-attack while playing with Michael’s son in the family garden. Michael is now alone in the matters of the family business and takes control. Michael Corleone goes to assassin the other family dons and Michael cleans house within his own family, executing Tessio, the betrayer of the family interests and also orders the killing of Carlo, the husband of Connie and the man we discover that had set up Sonny be to killed in the streets.&lt;br /&gt;
The denouement of the movie occurs when we see the capos address Michael Corleone as Don Corleone and as the door is closed on Kay, Michael’s wife.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no doubt that the movie is of the Gangster genre. The plot, typical of gangster movies, involves the story of multiple men who find success in America through atypical and often illegal means and must struggle with the consequences of the actions of their crime-led lives. The movie gives us an interesting insight into the culture of the crime family. Brute force is done only after a polite request. After that request being denied, these people are “made an offer that they cannot refuse.”&lt;br /&gt;
Although the movie was released in 1972, the movie takes place shortly after the end of World War II. The outfits, the cars, the general mood of the movie is nostalgic, and even the way the mobsters conduct themselves seems to be from another world, or perhaps “an old world”. Although the portrayal of the movie is set in the 1940s, when the movie was released in 1972 the Mafia was still a major player in the underground market for crime, leading to further fascination of the public concerning the Mafia. The previous decades saw the rise of communism, the assassination of Kennedy, the entry into Vietnam, Kent State as well as the Civil Rights movement. All over the country there was turmoil and unease concerning the government’s ability to maintain discipline and order.&lt;br /&gt;
We are almost shocked to see how ruthless the crime families operate. But at the same time, we are in awe at how they conduct themselves. Amidst the killings and illegal activities, there is an old way of doing things. And the basis of that way of doing things, according to Don Corleone, is respect. And with that respect the Corleone and the other crime families operate from the highest position of Don to the capos and basic thugs.&lt;br /&gt;
One can’t help but wonder – does the Mafia handle things more efficiently than our politicians? And if the politicians and police are hand in hand with the crime families, just how far does the corruption go? Can one still hold some form of faith in the powers that be?&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, The Godfather was a land mark moment for the perceptions of the Italians. For years the Italians had been immigrating to the United States. And their presence in the country was not well appreciated at all. And apart from the movies that portrayed Italians as spaghetti and meatball eating “talk-a like-a dis-a”, The Godfather was one of the first movies that portrayed the structure of the Italian family to American audiences. Amidst the crime and killing, you are introduced to the family as humans. They are all people with problems and who just happen to be involved in crime as a way of surviving. Francis Ford Coppola was himself an Italian and Sicilian, so I think that portrayal of the Italian family in The Godfather was in many ways authentic to the experience of the immigrant experience as an Italian or Sicilian.&lt;br /&gt;
And of course Francis Ford Coppola is considered one of a few key directors who were part of the New Hollywood movement. This new movement, led by a number of younger directors was the key to the revival of commercial success in film. Instead of the studio system where the studio held the majority sway on what happened in a film, the New Hollywood movement was instead based on the authority of the director. So while other film movements happened by choice, New Hollywood happened as a result of the growing of commercial television as well as the demise of the studio system. So the New Hollywood movement rather happened as a fact of necessity rather than be real “choice” of style, genre, or editing.&lt;br /&gt;
And this new movement was commercially and artistically a major success for the studio groups and the directors. The Godfather is proof of this, having won major awards such as the Oscars for best picture and actor as well as generally being a financial success. Furthermore, The Godfather is considered one of the most influential films for the gangster genre. The film stands as a massive achievement of the New Hollywood movement as well as the talent of Francis Ford Coppola being more than adequately displayed in the film. Italian Americans also watched the movie and found comfort in the portrayal of the Italians are more than just thugs or gangsters. And they also found pride in that it was the Italians, who came from so far a country to a place where they were called racial slurs and told to go back home that created an empire that was to be feared by all who had an interest in real power – a sort of frightful respect.&lt;/p&gt;
