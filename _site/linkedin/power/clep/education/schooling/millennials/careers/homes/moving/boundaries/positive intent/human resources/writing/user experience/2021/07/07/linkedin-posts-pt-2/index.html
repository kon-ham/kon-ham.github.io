  <p>I’ve taken jabs at LinkedIn because I’ve felt that the overall platform encouraged low quality (I feel like the quality of the content is sterile and all the same), but then I was reminded that LinkedIn is an advertising platform first and a professional rolodex second.</p>

<p>Everyone else is just along for the ride.</p>

<hr />

<p>In an ideal world power structures reflect actual business structure so that it is clear to everyone who has skin in the game.</p>

<hr />

<p>What is the role of the in-person encounter when the majority of person-to-person encounters happen through the digital space?</p>

<hr />

<p>We should stop telling young adults that paying MSRP for university degrees is the right way to go.</p>

<p>If you know a young person that might be considering college and is considering a non-STEM degree, then perhaps ask them to consider alternatives. You can mostly CLEP out the first two years of college and spend less than $5,000 for the first two years of college. (Each CLEP exam is less than 200 dollars per test and gives you full credit for a college course)</p>

<p>Besides the millennial mistake of believing and buying the college lie, there are other obstacles facing millennials.</p>

<p>Here is my strategy for millennials.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Change careers that allow you to work from home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Abandon the big city living. This is a tough one for me. Big cities usually mean lots of food choices.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You define the definition of small town. This pretty much means not NYC, LA, ATL, HOUSTON, SAN FRAN, and so on.</p>

<p>Small towns mean less competition. Bigger towns mean lots of competition from already wealthy buyers</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save in the small town as you prepare for a downpayment on a house.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>When applying the adage of “good fences make good neighbors” to personal social boundaries, I think this is a really good idea.</p>

<p>I think this means that there is a certain level of basic fence making that needs to happen even before establishing boundaries with others.</p>

<p>Not all boundaries need to be explicitly expressed when first establishing contact with a person. That would be weird and tiresome.</p>

<p>Here are some of those basic fence structures:</p>

<p>1) You do not have to continue speaking with anyone. You may stop speaking with anyone immediately. You continue speaking with whomever you please because those people assume a basic level of respect with you.</p>

<p>2) You don’t have to feel sorry for sticking up for yourself. In any situation that involves sticking up for yourself has occurred, it’s already an unfortunate circumstance for anyone. Do not feel sorry for doing this.</p>

<p>3) You have preferences for everything. You don’t have to have a long-winded reason for why you dislike something or if you do. You are OK with giving straight forward but polite answers.</p>

<p>4) You always reserve the right to say no and you will practice it.</p>

<p>It is very easy when you are wanting something (like a job) how willing you might be to disrespect your own boundaries.</p>

<p>But don’t do that! Good fences make good neighbors.</p>

<hr />

<p>“On why you can almost always assume positive intent”</p>

<p>Consider this: if a person must decide between having a negative or positive relationship with someone, that person will choose to have positive relationships with others.</p>

<p>This is probably almost always 100% of the time.</p>

<p>People don’t want to be in broken relationships.</p>

<p>We can almost always assume positive intent with others.</p>

<p>But make sure that doesn’t get you taken advantage of!</p>

<hr />

<p>It is because HR has become an institutionalized process inside of a business. It’s somewhat of a straight forward problem but in reality the application of a solution is difficult, as it would involve rearranging how HR does hiring.</p>

<p>Companies want to hire. People want to be hired. But it takes an institutional level of reform to reassess how we hire.</p>

<hr />

<p>The best way to find out about someone is to sample their writing.</p>
