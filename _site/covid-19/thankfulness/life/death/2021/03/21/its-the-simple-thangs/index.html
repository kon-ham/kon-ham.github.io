  <p>My parent’s PPP loan came in yesterday. To celebrate, my mom went to Aldi’s and purchased some sweets and cheese.</p>

<p>And though our dinner was simple, we had a little bit of wine together with the family along with those sweets and cheese.</p>

<p>And we had a great meal.</p>

<p>Pre-COVID my parents and I used to argue about where to go out for dinner. I’d complain that my dad always wanted to go to a Chinese buffet. My parents would complain about my complaining because they’d argue that the best value for going out was to go to a Chinese buffet. (In particular, they enjoy crawfish, snow crab and the eventual ice cream at the end of the meal.)</p>

<p>But now, we don’t go out for dinner anymore.</p>

<p>We stay inside, and sometimes, we will go to COSTCO to buy appetizer dishes you’d sometimes order at a restaurant.</p>

<p>But tonight, there was a feeling of gratitude and a bit of tiredness. (We had just spent the day doing some yardwork)</p>

<p>Tonight, we were grateful to be able to eat a meal together, enjoy simple luxuries, and to be able to spend time together.</p>

<p>My question for you today is this: What can you do to enjoy the simple things in life?</p>

<p>Our life has become immensely more complicated because of COVID. In some ways, it’s become more streamline. But it doesn’t hurt to look back at where you once came from (from nothingness) to now being able to enjoy a sweet and delicious piece of cake or pie and to share that moment together with loved ones.</p>

<p>One day you will die. One day your health will fail you.</p>

<p>In light of that, though I don’t necessarily argue that you should eat drink and be merry for tomorrow is uncertain, I argue instead that you should be thankful for the small things in your life. If you have health, be thankful you have health. If you do not have health but are able to still read this message, be thankful you have life and yet still time to be able to make the best of things.</p>

<p>Today, make the choice to be thankful. Maybe get you an ice cream cone with a loved one. Maybe go out and get you a manicure or whatever. Maybe cuddle up in bed and read a nice book.</p>

<p>Today, make the choice to be thankful.</p>
