  <p>Now is a great time to be alive, reassess your situation, and think about how you want your situation to be when this blows over in two or three years. Great changes are happening as a result of this, and it is a good time now to ponder upon your situation while you may be in quarantine.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take the time to relax, sure. Watch some Netflix.</p>

<p>But you need to think about where you want to be in three years.</p>
