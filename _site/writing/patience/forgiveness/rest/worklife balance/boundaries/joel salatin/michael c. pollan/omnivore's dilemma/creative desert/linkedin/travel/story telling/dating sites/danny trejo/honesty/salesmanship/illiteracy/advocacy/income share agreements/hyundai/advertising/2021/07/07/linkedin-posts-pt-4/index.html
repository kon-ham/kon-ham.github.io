  <p>I see a lot of posts from people that say they are open to work.</p>

<p>Yet they hardly post anything else.</p>

<p>Part of life is being OK with rejection. Not everyone will like your thoughts. However, it is probably best you do a favor to everyone else to make it very easy and quick to say “no” to you.</p>

<p>Be willing to share your thoughts, even if you feel they are immature. We will debate those thoughts on the open theatre. Not everyone is right. It is OK to be wrong.</p>

<p>But we need more people willing to share their opinions and deeply held convictions in the right context. (reading: Six Thinking Hats – Dr. Edward de Bono)</p>

<p>Just be willing to share in humility and love for your fellow humanity.</p>

<p>Our problem now is that we have sterility.</p>

<p>We need to share our thoughts more and open the proverbial can of worms. We need more discourse.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be patient with others. I have a friend that has allowed a leech into her life. It drives me up to the wall to hear her complaints.</p>

<p>Always try you best to be patient. And it’s probably best you say very little. Even if you think you have a good idea.</p>

<p>And I’ll try to take my own advice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Life is too short to have enemies. Forgive and move on. You don’t have to best buddies with everyone. You can limit contact.</p>

<p>But always be willing to forgive and remember that you could be an enemy to someone else. Humility is a big takeaway here.</p>

<hr />

<p>Have one day of rest.</p>

<p>Two days of rest might be a problem because you start to forget quicker than you might think and it takes effort to get the ball rolling again.</p>

<p>One day of rest allows for creative inspiration and, reminds you that work is not all there is to your existence.</p>

<p>When you rest you should remember the people that brought you into this world, the ones that helped you to become what you are now, and to also forgive your enemies.</p>

<p>After all, if you do not forgive you only continue to poison yourself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Work advice:</p>

<p>I am unemployed so take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Be willing to say “no” more often than you are willing to say “yes”. This applies to most all situations.</p>

<p>It is easier to get into something than it is to get out of it.</p>

<p>This definitely applies to purchasing a vehicle at a stealer- I mean, dealership.</p>

<hr />

<p>We need people to apply a Joel Salatin approach to the professional world. For reference, check out Michael C. Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma”.</p>

<p>We live in a professional world of sterility that as a whole, creates a weaker species that is prone to sickness. Having biodiversity in terms of germs and microorganisms allows for a stronger species.</p>

<p>The sort of sterility we have in the professional workplace leads only to one product – one that is weak from outside attack, artificial, and can only exist in a system that is entirely dependent on subsidies.</p>

<p>Encourage specialization and diversity that is appropriate to your climate and region. You will produce better crops that have higher nutritional content. Happier livestock also.</p>

<hr />

<p>LinkedIn is a creative desert and a poor representation of the potential of the depths of the human experience – especially as a business professional.</p>

<p>Meanwhile LinkedIn prospers off of our creative and spiritual starvation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Watching a TV show about traveling. Hosts go to Bali. They are trying to convey that cheap yet value locations can be had for those that look.</p>

<p>This is true. You can travel for cheap.</p>

<p>However, for most people, while cash is a priority, the biggest cost for people is opportunity. People have to put in vacation days (if you are privileged to have vacation days) in order to travel.</p>

<p>Cost of cash is secondary. First is opportunity cost. Most Americans, despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world in comparison to other nations, cannot afford to travel because of the opportunity cost.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think there’s an opportunity in building a media company that specializes in story telling.</p>

<p>Seeing loads of movies being rehashed lately makes me think that we may be close to being creatively bankrupt. This is not to say that good movies aren’t been made. I’m saying that the frequency of good movies being made lately seems to have dropped.</p>

<p>People need stories to inspire and uplift themselves and others.</p>

<p>If you’ve watched certain Disney movies as a child you can remember the emotional impact those movies made on you.</p>

<p>How about Lion King? Pinocchio? Land Before Time?</p>

<p>With the news of Amazon purchasing MGM, I’m led to believe that there is an opportunity for those that want to create a small media company that can take advantage of current technologies to create and deliver high quality and impactful stories. Using CGI technologies like Blender (which is open source and a beautiful example of the quality open source projects can demonstrate) and utilizing cloud storage services like AWS could be a huge advantage to those that want to engage in this.</p>

<p>Years ago it was cost prohibitive to create movies that demonstrated scale and grandeur. This was the age of Tinseltown. Scale and grandeur can now be done digitally by a few skilled and passionate artists.</p>

<p>How about if someone created a streaming service online that encouraged small and independent creators to create stories?</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’ve been on a dating site you know that the whole thing is like the Wild West.</p>

<p>Lots of unmet needs with people that just want another person to connect with, socially and romantically.</p>

<p>Possibly an opportunity in creating a dating app that fixes some of the current issues of the dating market.</p>

<p>First, nasty messages from strangers. Perhaps enforcing video-only chat instead of messaging will help others to be accountable to being a normal human being instead of a stranger with no accountability, which, I think encourages nasty or lazy messages.</p>

<p>Might be good to have a review system for each profile. Reputable people stand out, disreputable people are buried and eventually banned.</p>

<p>Secondly, I can’t help but feel dating apps encourage people to forever stay on these sites. After all, if your business model is based on match making what better than to have people forever stuck in match-making hell?</p>

<p>Finally, a model that moves away from swiping left and right. When you’re bombarded with a thousand profiles everyone starts to look the same after a while.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts for someone that might want to pick up an opportunity to make real changes in the lives of others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Loads of bots on these dating sites. Getting rid of chat messaging and relying only on video messaging will give your dating app a leg up against bots. They have bots that can fake messages, but deep fake AI is not there yet to be able to fake a video call.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Commenting on a young gal that had her graduation photos taken at the migrant farm her parents worked at.</em></p>

<p>While I appreciate this story, I can’t help but wonder if Jennifer working in the fields led her to a greater human experience and maturity than did the college degree…</p>

<hr />

<p>A few takeaways from this article:</p>

<p>1) Danny Trejo is a good man. We can all learn from his character.<br />
2) James Edward Olmos, albeit a brilliant actor, may have forgotten to know his place. He is an actor, not a gang member. When you can, it’s probably best to stay humble and stay in your lane.<br />
3) Don’t disrespect the complexity of human culture. For an actor putting on an cholo outfit is a means to an end. For others, it is a way of life.<br />
4) We should try not to become so lost in our achievements that we forget where we came from and the impact we may have on others. (Possibly 10 people were killed as a result of bad choices in the making of “American Me”)<br />
5) We should be sensitive to where people come from and acknowledge that experience.<br />
6) Former convicts are people that have had to deal with an enormous amount of dehumanization at the hands of the prison industrial complex. There is room for change here.<br />
7) A great way to market your product is to give people free content. I will probably buy this book as a result of reading from this excerpt.</p>

<p>One final takeaway from this article (and probably most important):</p>

<p>https://lnkd.in/d8vWixU</p>

<p>Do not lie. You may be tempted to tell an exaggeration in order to demonstrate your product. It will bite you again later. Do not lie.</p>

<p>Always strive for honesty. It’s better to scrap a project or lose customers by telling them the truth. Your customers will respect you more when you are willing to take a loss in the name of honesty. This is how you can become an industry leader.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you have a service or product that you want to share with the world, it is very easy, as the creator, to assume that everyone else knows what problem your product is meant to solve.</p>

<p>Please don’t make this assumption – always be willing to demonstrate.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is probably an opportunity for a person that wants to specialize in a mixture of web development, UX, marketing, and knowing what it is like to be illiterate.</p>

<p>My mom is not able to read beyond a basic level of English.</p>

<p>Yet, everyday she manages to make purchases on Amazon, which is an English speaking site. How does she get around the search engine and out of the millions of products find exactly what she needs?</p>

<p>I believe there is an incredible amount of opportunity in bringing people that are illiterate or somewhat illiterate (usually immigrants or even communities with disabilities like deaf or hard of hearing people) into the tech space.</p>

<p>Serving the underserved can be very rewarding. “Many such cases.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Any person wanting to advocate for change for the poor and meek should spend six months with no income and no cash funds to see what it is like to be an average American.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw of those wanting to advocate change for society is that they become disconnected with the people they are advocating change for.</p>

<hr />

<p>A company starting a business model based on ISA probably has not worked in religious ministries.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems of working in religious ministries is that you need money and since you do not operate in a traditional sense of profit you must resort to begging for money. This is a problem of cash flow.</p>

<p>Begging for money dilutes your mission, which probably has a conflict on interest in companies like Pathrise or Lambda School. By begging I mean unrealistic expectations or love bombing potential clients.</p>

<p>Paul Graham, you’re right that Lambda is better than brick and mortar – but Lambda with ISA is not the right model.</p>

<p>Have students invest with cash. Keep them invested in your program. Free only works for the most virtuous, which is really, nobody in reality.</p>

<hr />

<p>Income share agreements seem to be generally a bad idea. Your company is starved for cash because you’re investing 6-12 months into a potential client and in order to keep things afloat you need to ask money for investors who are generally, annoying about asking for their return on investments.</p>

<p>Perhaps the better approach is to start a company that is cash-flow rich and does not rely on vultur- I mean investors.</p>

<p>ISA is commitment heavy and you’re going to burn a lot of bridges getting your company to be at a respectable place. We live in a low-trust society. ISAs don’t work well in such a society.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hyundai thinks it’s better to include fictional characters in its advertisement instead of talking about its 100,000 mile powertrain warranty.</p>

<p>How much are these ads, Hyundai? $25,000 to display a 30 second ad? People watch this and think about how cute your ad was and then they go buy a Toyota.</p>
