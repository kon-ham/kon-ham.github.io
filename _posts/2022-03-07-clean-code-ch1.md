title: Summary of "Clean Code", Ch. 1
---
This is a summary of Martin's "Clean Code". That means there is no idea here that is original to my own - I am summarizing the material for my learning and in case you might want a quick summary. All credit goes to Martin.

## On Clean Code
Essentially the topic of this book could be called "How to Care for Code" (Martin)

Code is still relevant. 

Code is a representation of the details of requirements. Specifying requirements in a detail that a machine can execute them is programming. The specifications are code.

Code will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute.

We will never create machines that do what we want instead of what we say.

Not even humans are able to create successful systems from vague feelings of their customers.

Because of that, code is still relevant and wll always be relevant.

"Code is the language in which we express requirements. We may have languages that are close to those requirements but we will never eliminate necessary precision." (Martin)

It is our responsibility as programmers to develop clean code. If necessary, you must defend the code to your managers who may feel pressured to push you to work quickly. It can be common for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.

Martin goes further, saying "No matter how fast you go, the only way to actually make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep code as clean as possible." (Martin) because bad code will eventually get so bad that it can no longer be managed. It will bring your company down.

So if you want to go fast, code so that is easy to write and make it easy to read.

Clean code does one thing well. It is focused with all functions, classes, and each module "exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details" (Martin)

Clean code is crisp, matter-of-fact, without hesitation or unnecessary detail. Clean code makes it easy for others to enhance your code. Clean code is tested code. Code that is untested is not clean, no matter how elegant.

Smaller code is better.

## How we are authors of code
We are authors. Authors have readers.

Authors are responsible for communicating well with their readers. Remember you are an author writing for readers that will judge your effort. (Martin)

The time spent reading code to writing code is 10:1. We constantly read old code to write new code.

Since this ratio is high, we want to be sure we write code that is easy to read.

Writing code that is easy to read makes code easy to write.

## The effects of bad code
Bad code tempts the mess to grow.

A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about it. So other people stop caring.

## On Beauty
Just as we can see a painting and see if it's painted beautifully or horrifically, we can do the same with code.

We want code to be _elegant_, which we emphasize on being _pleasing_

## On "code-sense"
We want to develop a "code-sense". Some are born with it, some must acquire it.

A programmer without code-sense will look at a messy module, recognize the mess, and will have no idea what to do with it. A programmer with code-sense will be able to make decisions based off options and variations.

## The Boy Scout Rule
Abide by the Boy Scout rule. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

We abide by this because it is not enough to write code well. It must be kept clean over time. We must take an active approach to preventing degradation.

Clean code looks like it is written by someone who cares. When you come in to maintain code written by another person you can sit in appreciation for what they've done.

Clean code is code that has to be taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly.
