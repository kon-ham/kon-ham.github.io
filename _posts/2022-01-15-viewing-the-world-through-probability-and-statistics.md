title: Viewing the World Through Probability and Statistics
---

Your chance of dying in a car crash is 1 in 107 over a life time.

That's less than a 1% chance of death. Yet every year, people die in automobile accidents.

Certainly there needs to be a cautiously rational estimation of the cost when it comes to how we approach projects or new endeavors.

But life viewed solely through a lens of statistics, probability and percentages is a bleak one and one that is terminally myopic in view. It does not paint enough of a portrait for us to be able to reliably navigate the world. The data is always changing. We could have bad sources.

We must be courageous in being willing to dive into these new projects because we have a belief of hope that the work we do is worth doing and that it will eventually payoff.

When the Europeans set sail for the Americas their chance of death was probable if not likely. Yet they sailed because they had a belief that the potential reward was worth the risk.

You don't need to know the exact final conclusion of your life. You must simply believe that the work you put into will pay off sooner or later.

This is an exercise in letting go of control (or the supposed perception of control) over the events of your life.

Do your best. Let go - and enjoy the ride.
