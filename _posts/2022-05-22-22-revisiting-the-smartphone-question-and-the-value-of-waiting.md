## Most of life will slip through your fingers
Most of life is spent wasted or spent waiting for something to happen. This is true now as it was when man sat around waiting for his crops to bear fruit. No matter how much you try, time will always manage to slip through your fingers. 

Understandably, it is very easy to look at the sea of people staring into their phones and feel a sense of wonder, if not uneasiness. "How can they just spend all their time on their phones?", a Baby Boomer might ask.

Well, what did Baby Boomers do to pass the time, and was the time they spent somehow of higher quality than the time people spend on their phones? Doubtful. 

## The paradox of information within our fingertips
Given that we have the greatest collection of knowledge and information since the history of humanity within the palm of our hands, it's a bit of surprise that young people can barely count or have any interest in reading meaningful work.

But is this really the fault of our smartphones or is the fault elsewhere? To be clear, I put most of the blame on our schooling system, but that's for another discussion.

## The fleetingness of time, a thematic lesson in human story telling
Most of time is wasted. Or it is time spent waiting. For the most part, life is waiting in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Grab a ticket. Hurry up and wait. 

In fact, many great novels and stories of the exploration of the human experience come from this theme of waiting or being stuck. Edmond Dantes of the Count of Monte Cristo was imprisoned for 14 years. Joseph, interpretor of dreams, was imprisoned for a similar period. Chuck Noland from the movie Cast Away was stranded for 4 years. 

## Facing the reality of being stuck
There will always be time sinks. No matter how much you optimize for your life, someone or something will cause you to bleed into the waiting game.

It is not how long you are waiting that is important, but rather the *quality* of waiting that you are doing, given the fact that you are stuck where you are.

## All great things take time
Careers do not develop overnight. Wonderful ideas and beautiful thoughts don't just come to you (and if they do, they're probably just shower thoughts - which we might define as impractical ideas). 

Edmond Dantes probably spent most of his time weeping and being beaten by the prison gaurds. Joseph probably spent most of his time also weeping and feeling sorry for himself. Chuck Noland spent most of his time gazing into the horizon for someone to come and save him.

But given that most of the time slipped away, Edmond Dantes still learned. He was illiterate before he was imprisoned but he learned to read, write, and to mathematics. Joseph learned to pray. Chuck learned survival skills. 

These important skills didn't happen over night, nor did these characters "grind it out" and work on their skills 8 hours a day. I gaurantee you somedays Edmond Dantes, Chuck Noland, and Joseph spent the day weeping in sorrow.

But every day they probably learned a little bit more.

## What's important is that you learn just a little bit more
You're stuck. No matter how hard you try, you cannot make time move faster. And you cannot rewind the tapes. You can only produce in this moment. 

One day you'll be in a different cirucmstance. Until then, try to just do a little today. And a little tomorrow. 

## The smartphone is a red herring, the real question is how are we passing our time
With smartphones, it is not the fact that we are staring into the phones that is the problem. The important question is, *are we passing that time productively while we gaze into our smartphones*?

## Make no mistake, we must be productive
Time was once a gift to humanity - we were giften with time so that we can cherish it and to enjoy the fruit of life that was too be enjoyed eternally. But now it has become our court date - where when that time comes due we will need to give an account of our lives.

We must be productive. We must use the time we have to the best of our ability to be servants to others by producing good works. But no matter what, time will pass and we will need to sleep after a hard day of work.

So accept the life that you've been given. Accept the reality of time. And make the best of your situation.
