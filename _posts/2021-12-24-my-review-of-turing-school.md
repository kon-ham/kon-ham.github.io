title: My Review of Turing's School of Software and Design
---

This is not a sponsored post. I am writing this because I want to share my own opinions about Turing and to possibly answer any questions a person might have about choosing to enroll in a software development school (or as we know it, coding boot camp). 

So you don't have to read ahead: Yes, a software development school has much more value than learning by yourself or obtaining a computer science degree. 

With caveats.
