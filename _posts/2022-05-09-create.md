title: We're all gonna be alright

An old man rolls up to me
On his bike he carries his life
A small sleeping bag and some food for the night
He sees me and says, 'Are you homeless like me'
I shrug my shoulders and I don't say a word
Looking at me he then fears the worst - 
'That's OK. You're gonna be alright', he says
'We're all gonna be alright'
He pedals away and I never see him again
Well I'm alright now and I'm doing well
But now I worry and hope that the old man is alright
And doing well
I hope we're all gonna' be alright
