title: Chinese Cooking and Poached Chicken

Chinese cooking has increasingly been the target of my admiration - there are so many different flavors and textures that dance, tease, and flirt with my mouth that sometimes it's overwhelming for my Western acclimated palate. 

Chinese cooking is deceptively simple.

Today I tried a Chinese poached chicken recipe which called for a whole chicken to be boiled for around 5 minutes before letting it simmer for about 45 minutes. Afterwards, the chicken is granted a refreshing dunk in an ice bath.

I did so, and when I began carving my chicken I realized it was mostly uncooked. I restarted my process 3 times in total before finally managing to get what I wanted.

By then I could already touch the meat and confirm the chicken was now rubbery and tough.

Of course, I will eat my failures with the hope that I'll remember well enough to do better next time. 

Here are a few mistakes I made:

- I bought a chicken that was too big. This was a roasting chicken that was approximately 9 pounds. Way too big of a project for this recipe. Smaller chicken next time. Easier to digest in more ways than one.

- I misunderstood simmer. Next time I'll set the heat to a temperature where I can see some heat action in the water. My heat setting was too low. 

- I was juggling learning Swift, listing an item on eBay, trying to finish off Clavell's Shogun on audiobook, and eating dinner. Too many moving pieces caused a distraction of my attention. Less is more.

At least hopefully, tomorrow my ginger scallion sauce will be good enough so that I can enjoy my rubbery chicken with a delicious dipping sauce.

As a side note, I'm finally settled. The moving has been costly with both money and my time. But I'm happy here and I'm also pleased with the fact that I'm no longer paying a state income tax.

The overall cost of living here is also lower (for my needs). I pay a monthly rent of 1005 dollars for a 1 bedroom. Granted, the fixtures and overall building is showing its age but I am happy with it.

I think this was better done now rather than later, so a big project (and dream) of mine is now finally finished.

Thanks for reading! G'night ya'll.
