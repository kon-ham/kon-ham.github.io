title: A list of value I'm adding to my current company
---

I figure I'd go ahead and start compiling a list of projects and ideas I'm sharing with the current company I'm working with. First, I figure listing this out will inspire me to continue adding to it and second, I think publically demonstrating my value will help to remind me to continually add to this list.

Due to privacy concerns, some of the details will be abstracted. If you're curious about what sort of details I've been involved with, please let me know.

Here it is:

 - Identify, communicate, and collaborate on problem of bottle neck in shipment of code: 
	 - Currently tests were taking up to 10 hours for certain procedures. The fact that tests took a long time were known but there was no movement on reducing total number of hours of testing. 
	 - Problem was that DB engineers were under the assumption that my team was testing code that should have taken _no longer than 10 minutes to test_ when in reality they were taking hours. 
	 - I communicated that we followed appropriate test procedures and with proof of concept demonstrated that our testing time was abnormal.
	 - Conservatively, assuming test time was reduced from 2 hours for each test to 10 minutes and on any given day we are testing three separate files at a time, I probably contributed freeing up the company hundreds of hours of testing time.
- Identify, communicate, and collaborate on key feature of product to log error messages as a part of its output of work.
	- Current product feature output work to a Gsheet document. Inevitably when bugs occur there were no generation of error messages to indicate where an issue had gone wrong.
	- I identified and communicated with engineers assigned to that portion of the product to assist with brainstorming that error logging capability. I continued to collaborate with feedback and input as to what sort of messages would be useful for engineers on the team I am assigned to so that we can more effectively troubleshoot. 
	- An added benefit to this feature is that it can stand as a predecessor to when the product becomes more user driven and those error messages can be swapped out with more user-friendly messages.
- I organized a 30-minute weekly meeting where engineers from my team engaged in a 'show-and-tell' where we share wins or tricks we've learned to increase our productivity. This meeting went for up to 30 minutes but if team members had nothing to pass the meeting ended in 5 minutes, giving everyone back 25 minutes.
- I created XYZ number of documents as I began my onboarding/ramping up process so that I can more effectively learn the product as well as designing the material so that they can act as future onboarding documents for the next engineer that comes after me. 
- I was tasked with and had ownership of the completion of 72 Jira issues so far. Granted, I understand completion of Jira tickets is not necessarily an indication of the _useful_ work that I've been doing - but it should help people to get an idea of the frequency of custom solutions I am building for clients on a given lifetime.
