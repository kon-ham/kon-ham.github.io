If your society produces more stories or music of heartbreak instead of reconciliation, growth, and progress, then you have a negative society and you should be careful not to drink that water.

There is a place for heartbreak. But if it's everywhere then it's indicative of a broken society. A healthy society produces love songs that are healthy and produces good fruit.

We probably live in a broken society because the majority of our popular love songs revolve around heartbreak.
