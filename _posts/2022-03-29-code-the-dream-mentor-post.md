## Mentor of the Month at Code the Dream
Code the Dream was kind enough to recognize my volunteer work at Code the Dream and to select me for mentor of the month of February.

They asked me to write a few sentences about myself and naturally I said more than a few sentences - but they posted it anyways on a blog post.

I thought it was interesting enough to share here in case anyone wants to read it:

"When asked why he values his work s a CTD volunteer, Kon responded with this message:"

> My name is Kon. Iâ€™m a software engineer at a growing tech startup in
> Boston, Massachusetts that builds products for engineering management.
> 
> I was born in Korea. My parents immigrated to the US when I was 1 or 2
> years old.
> 
> I love coding because coding gives me an opportunity to be part of a
> team that solves problems creatively, elegantly, and effectively. I
> love coding because there is sufficient depth of material that I know
> I can spend the rest of my life improving my coding skills. Finally, I
> love coding because it gives me a fulfilling job that meets my
> lifestyle needs.
> 
> I love to volunteer at Code the Dream because it is an encouragement
> to see new faces every day that are desiring to learn a valuable skill
> to contribute to the growing field of tech. Those new faces are a
> representation of the many different cultures, backgrounds, and
> experiences that can one day be leveraged to make the world a better
> place.
> 
> I love volunteering at Code the Dream because it is a mission that is
> close to my heart. For approximately 20 years I was undocumented in a
> country that I loved.
> 
> I love the people, I love the land, and I love the values. Because of
> that, six months after I was naturalized, I joined the armed services
> as an enlisted member of the United States military. But for better or
> worse, that experience of being undocumented made a deep and lasting
> impression on me.
> 
> With my background in mind, I continue my tradition of being in
> service to others by volunteering my time at Code the Dream. I
> volunteer here because I believe people are not wrong or criminals for
> existing. I believe those same people from traditionally
> underrepresented or historically excluded groups can demonstrate and
> contribute value in a growing and incredibly important industry.
> 
> I volunteer at Code the Dream because I believe that I can make an
> impact on this field by volunteering my time be a mentor.
