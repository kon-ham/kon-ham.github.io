title: Don't Forget to Dream Big
---
It is our dreams that propel us forward.

Everyday and every moment of your life is motivated by the dreams of your heart. 

Within it you have passions, hopes, and visions that enable you to get up every day and to live your life.

It is our dreams that propel us forward.

If I may encourage you - dream big.

Those dreams come from somewhere deeper and bigger than yourself.

They come from nature or nature's creator and they transcend our understanding of time and space.

Not only that, your dreams are inherited from others. It is not only just your dreams but the dreams of others from generations past.

Are you feeling down? Are you feeling without hope?

Remember your dreams. This can only be done when you're no longer putting out fires but rather you have time and space to think strategically. 

Today, resolve to dream. The other fires in your life will sooner or later take care of themselves. This means that if you can, try not to worry. 

There is a time and place for putting your nose to the grindstone to put in the hard work needed to reap the well deserved fruit of your labor. 

But today, may I encourage you to remember to look up at the moon and the vast stars of the sky and remember: Dreams are eternal.

Today, remember to dream. Remember to live for a dream bigger than yourself.

Dream. And remember to dream big. 

Let's together dream of a future better and bigger than ourselves and our current situation. 

Dreamer, today may all of your dreams come true.
