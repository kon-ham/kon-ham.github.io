title: The Importance and Unfortunate Erosion of Trust

### On trust
I think one of the greatest reasons why I am growing at my current company is that I am continually building trust with my supervisor.

This is not to say that *I* am building trust, but rather a mutual building of trust between both parties.

### Trust to fly
After a certain point, a young bird must leave the nest. The bird must trust that its mother knows when to push it out of the nest, and the mother must trust that the bird will fly.

Of course, not always do the young birds fly. Sometimes it ends unfortunately.

But regardless of the ultimate ending, the young bird must fly and the mother must trust the young bird to fly.

I think, wonder, and lament about the erosion of trust in our society. I can't help but feel that at the end of the day, people want to feel secure. We have an entire civilization of people that are empty, insecure, and unable to grow because we have no where to hide, no refuge of trust to shelter in.

### Security from the darkness within
I want to know that sometimes I may say something inappropriate or silly and that I will still be accepted as a person - that my inappropriate or silly comment or action will simply melt away under the light of trust from friends, family, and community. At the end of the day, I want to know that even though there is something deeply dark within me, that I have a network of people who will support me to overcome that darkness.

I think it is within this domain of trust that people grow intimately and deeply.

### Mistakes turn to opportunity with trust
Life is about making mistakes - hopefully small or minor ones - but mistakes nonetheless. Then after making those mistakes one must overcome and learn from those mistakes. If we don't have a sphere, a home, cave, or nest from which we can spring from to conquer new challenges, it becomes very difficult to grow and to build.

From commerce to friendship, a relationship is built upon trust.

I look back at my own life and I can painfully remember how petty I was, how distrustful I was, and how unwilling I was to give someone space to make something wonderful out of themselves, through and from the mistakes they made.

I think a good manager, coach, teacher, friend, leader, and lover must cultivate and guard that trust with their lives. Too often we see circumstances where people in positions of power taking advantage of that trust. We react to these events with the same sickening feeling because we know how intimate and vulnerable we are within that space of trust. 

### Do you want to be a better leader? 
Cultivate trust by letting people have the space to grow through mistakes and introspection. 

And to the best of your ability, never betray that trust.

### Have you betrayed that trust?
Understand that you paid for those actions with resources that you did not have. You are in debt. You are in the red. It will take time, if not decades to rebuild that trust. But like with real debt, every day chip away at the debt and one day you'll be free.

### In the future we'll all be free
One day we'll all be free in an entire universe of trust. We'll one day live in a world where even all the living creatures will approach us freely, because trust has been reestablished on a universal level.

Let's all work towards chipping away the debt of the betrayal of trust, and to make good works with our hands, our feet, and our hearts.
