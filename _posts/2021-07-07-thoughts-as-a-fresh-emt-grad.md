By the time I graduated EMT school, I learned there was a million and one ways to die.

Here are a few tips from an EMT newbie that might save your life or the life of a loved one.

If you are going to the beach you’ve never been to before, understand that you are at danger of drowning. You do not know the water. Do not disrespect the sea. The sea has an excellent record of taking lives. It is the equivalent of running with scissors. You may drown. Know riptides can end your life quickly.

If you happen to nearly drown in sea water but manage to survive, go to the hospital anyways in case you dry drown. (The salt crystals in your lungs can cause you to foam and drown even if you’re not under water). Being under supervision overnight at the hospital may save your life.

If you feel good after drinking, you’re definitely drunk and you need to watch yourself.

Assume that everyone carries a gun. This means that you should not raise your voice at anyone that’s been out under the hot sun all day like you have been. There is a strong correlation with hot weather and violence. This means if you’ve been drinking shut your mouth if you’re not around people you know and trust.

If you encounter a drunk person, try your best to both mind your own business and also try to make sure that person is taken care of. Not all drunk looking people are drunk. Some of them are exhibiting drunk behaviors because they are diabetic despite not having touched an ounce of alcohol.

Also assume everyone is driving drunk. This is called defensive driving. Do not assume people know what they are doing when it comes to driving. A vehicle can be a means to end a person’s life. Watch yourself and your family.

Most importantly, enjoy but don’t enjoy at the expense of your life. Your life is too short to make a silly mistake that causes your loved ones to grieve over you. Enjoy this 4th of July in moderation and be thankful for this wonderful land of ours. The grass is still green and it still rains (in some parts). We can be thankful for such a beautiful place.

Also, try to keep your house looking busy. You go on vacation, naughty people go to work at your house. If you can, start getting to know your neighbors and ask they watch over your house.

Finally, if an unfortunate situation happens and you are in a position to potential help someone, you must ALWAYS ask yourself – IS THIS SITUATION SAFE. If it is not, you must not proceed. One life is already a tragedy. Do not proceed if the situation is not safe. You cannot help others if you yourself are not safe. Never disregard this.

Happy 4th of July, and may you all live long and prosper.
