Bill Murray holds this movie in high esteem. I believe he said it was something like, 'the greatest achievement of modern age comedy'.

This is not the first time I've seen this movie and I definitely recall my giggling as I went through this movie years ago. This time I took a more serious look at it. 

I think it's a funny movie. It's weird, charming, thoughtful, and sometimes sentimental. There's loads of symbolism that reveals a ton of deeper thoughts from the production crew.

If you haven't seen it, I think it's a good movie to pass a weekend with. As of May 22nd, 2022, I saw it for free on TubiTV.

I thought I'd share some of the symbolic lessons from the movie.

There's probably spoilers from here on forward, so if that sort of thing bothers you (I've never come across a spoiler that ruined a movie for me. In fact knowing the spoiler motivates me to watch it, if interesting enough)

## From loser to kung-fu master to layman
Sing is the main character. Sing is a loser. His aim is to con people out of money by impersonating more serious, tougher gangs. He fails miserably at this. His main purpose in this movie is to be beaten up. He cannot do anything right. Eventually, he is beaten so badly that every bone in his body is broken. He is essentially dead. He makes a miraculous comeback and in a way, is reborn into a kung-fu master. He defeats 'The Beast', another heinous kung-fu master, makes a student out of him, and the movie ends with a depiction of Sing becoming co-owners of a candy shop with his friend, his previous partner in crime.

Despite his enormous unlocked potential, we see that in the end, Sing has settled for life as a candy shop owner. There is no desire to 'change the world' with his unlocked potential. He is content to return to the real world as a layman after his kung-fu awakening.

The biggest critique I have of Marvel/comic book movies is that it is all hero and no Joe Schmoe. Even the so called 'regular' people in the Avengers movies are scientists, doctors, engineers that all are a part of the Avenger's ecosystem. The only time Joe Schmoe is even remotely referenced is when he gets a PG-13 rated implied death because he happened to be on his way back home from work when the Avengers and The Bad Guys decided to duke it out on the interstate.

The Incredibles said it best. Syndrome says to Mr. Incredible as Syndrome unveils his villainous master plan, 'Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super, no one will be.'

I think this is where we are at with the world - we are always on the next crusade because we want to be super heroes. Instead, I want to be a layperson. At the end of the day, it is regular people that make the world go 'round. Regular people taking out the trash, holding the door open for the person behind them, doing the dishes regular people drive the world forward. 

## Sometimes the most terrible beasts unleashed are the ones we unleash ourselves
Sing wants an easy life, so he makes a bargain with the Axe Gang so that he can become one of them. They give him a mission - to unlock 'The Beast', who is being held at a mental asylum. 

As Sing approaches the locked gate that holds 'The Beast', he envisions the hallway flooded with a river of blood. Plague creatures inhabit the hallway space. He knows there is a crossing of the Rubicon moment when he unlocks the gate.

Sometimes we are our own worst enemies. Sometimes the worst mistakes in our lives are the ones we willingly make and in doing so, our decisions and actions give birth to a monstrosity. Sometimes the worst enemies in our lives are the ones we unleash ourselves.

## Though The Beast is our greatest enemy, we must learn to make control it and to make it a servant to ourselves
In the climax of the movie, Sing defeats 'The Beast' and though he could easily kill 'The Beast' but he chooses to spare his life. The Beat, seeing a glimpse of the Sun shining upon Sing, breaks down in tears and falls on his knees, calling Sing 'master'.

We all have monstrosities in our lives - we must learn to discipline them and to overcome those monstrosities. The fact that Sing does not kill 'The Beast' says a lot, I think. I don't think it's possible to ever kill our own monstrosities, but rather we must learn to live with that monstrosity. Choices have consequences and what's done has been done. 

## Sometimes a setback is what we need to be reborn
Sing unlocks 'The Beast' and after a turn of events, is beaten into a pulp. He is nearly killed. But this near killing is what unlocks the kung-fu master in Sing. We should not fear setbacks. We should be prepared and avoid needless damage but we should never live in fear of losing everything. At the end of the day, we come into this world naked and we leave naked. There is nothing that can be taken from us that isn't one day going to be taken away through death. 

Assuming our setback isn't death, sometimes a setback is what we need to create a huge opportunity for ourselves. Sometimes the best lessons learned are the hard and painful ones. Again we should actively avoid painful lessons as we go about our lives but we should not live in fear of making mistakes.

## The past, present, future, are all related
As the movie progresses we are given a glimpse of Sing's past where, as a child he was scammed out of his life's savings by purchasing a worthless kung-fu book. He doesn't know it's worthless yet, but practicing its moves he sees a young girl who's about to have her candy stolen from a group of young bullies. Sing attempts to stop her but his scam kung-fu lessons are worthless as the boys beat Sing to a pulp and then, to add insult to injury, the young boys pee on Sing to further humiliate him. 

As the movie ends, we see a fruition of a coming together of time, as Sing is now a candy shop owner and he happens to see the same young girl who nearly had her candy stolen from the young bullies, but who is now a beautiful young lady. He runs out to see her, and as he does, they both transform into the same young children. 

Our past, our present, and our future have a connection. All of what happens in time happens for a reason and ultimately we are moving towards a conclusion of history where there will be a tying together of the loose ends of history. At the end, everything will be made right and people will find a deep and cathartic resolution to their lives as they see that all things in history led from the beginning to the end, all with purpose, and all with reason.

## The greatest achievement of the kungfu master was to lay down his life for another
The greatest achievement of kung-fu master Sing was not when he defeated 'The Beast', but rather when he was a naive young boy, unable to fight back against a group of young bullies as he tried to save a young deaf girl.

Sing's greatest achievement was being beaten to a pulp so that she wouldn't have to be. Sing's greatest glory was when he was pissed on by the young boys, who called him an idiot loser as they left feeling victorious. 

Great achievements are done in a spirit of servitude towards others. 

## Kung-fu masters are hiding in plain sight, all around you
We are introduced to the shop owners in a small village - as the movie progresses it is revealed that the shop owners as well as the land lords are kung-fu masters. They all have their own specialties which make them deadly to opponents.

All around you are people that are kung-fu masters. All of us bring to the table a special ability which makes us deadly to the enemy. Do not underestimate the shop owner, do not underestimate your neighbor. All of us have a special ability to put in the good fight.

What's remarkable about the kung-fu masters in this movie is that they are regular people until they are called to action. They are tailors, bread makers, and farmers who are living day to day. This is the reality of the world. The masters of the world are living in plain sight all around us. The real masters of the world are not the ones on magazine covers or on trending Instagram posts. They are your neighbors and friends, all hiding in plain sight.

## More kungfu heroes are coming
The final scene of the movie is that we see the same beggar who sold Sing the scam/worthless kung-fu book attempt to sell to another young boy the same spiel. The boy is uninterested, begins to walk away, and then the begger smiles, saying 'I have more', and we see the begger whip out not just a kung-fu book, but wrestling, Japanese sword-weilding, and numerous other different styles of martial arts.

We are kung-fu masters but the ones that will come after us will be even  more remarkable as the history of time and progress unfolds. The best time to be alive is now but the future is even better.

We are not the only kung-fu masters. Luckily, there will always be many more after us.

Here's to the future!
