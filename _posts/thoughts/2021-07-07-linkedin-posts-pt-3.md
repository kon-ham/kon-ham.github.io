I can’t help but feel most people just want plain honesty these days.

I think honesty in our work, with others, and in our own personal lives leads to great things. I’m working on this myself. It is not easy. But a good thing to strive for.

If companies clearly establish a unique service proposition, that is, what separates themselves from their competitors, it would do well to be honest in that USP. (unique service proposition)

I passed a store in Gatlinburg that had only one sign: “BOOTS: BUY ONE PAIR GET 2 PAIR FREE”. Now these people are being so honest that the drivers-by are coming in to see for themselves.

Being honest doesn’t mean that you sell yourself short nor does it mean to exaggerate.

Being honest means to live the best life you can live. Today. Now. And again Tomorrow. Always.

Being honest means to sell the best parts about you, accurately and without shame.

A way to monetize learning to play guitar. (Or any other skill, craft, or hobby)

Document your work with video efforts. Narrate your learning process from 0 all the way to the 6th month.

Edit the videos with the intention of creating a beginner’s guide to learning guitar.

Advertise on YouTube or whatever by listing a “before and after” video that adequately demonstrates your improvement from 0-6 months. Title it something like “LEARNING TO PLAY GUITAR – BEFORE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS”.

Sell the videos for whatever your asking price.

Enjoy the fruit of your labor – maybe you’ll buy a sweet new guitar amp.

Allegedly LinkedIn has had a security breach.

I didn’t see news for this anywhere on LinkedIn.

Ideas are usually unhinged thoughts.

They come and go. Most of your ideas are bad.

But one idea might really just need a solid application based on well…reality.

So don’t be ashamed of your terrible ideas. Freely share, if you care.

But this is why an “IDEAS” person is generally a useless position to be in. Everyone has ideas.

Application is where the money is at.

I am bothered by the idea that technology has transformed my life into little notification bars, status updates, and friend requests.

In automating my entire social and work life, my computer and the current state of ideas within the tech industry strip the human element out of more usual “primal” forms of social engagement. (Today, I was at a hardware store and after having had an enjoyable time with a representative, I saw his hand come up to throw the timeless shoulder pat but he seemed to retreat from the thought.)

I base these thoughts on the idea that most of the user experience is designed to encourage more response by the means of behavioral conditioning. Check out “The Social Dilemma” (2020) from Netflix.

It would be nice if user experience and the tech world in general strives to providing a more human-affirming experience – whatever that means.

You get to look cool in the masks but they are not fun to breathe in and moisture gets everywhere.

Proper technology should allow us to make better decisions about the future.

This is about as close to being God-like as we will ever get.

This means that we will need to have people more morally able to make good moral decisions, as we must make the right choice to enable a more righteous future.

Technology can get people killed. While most of us have forgotten about the Y2K event (or non-event, depending on perspectives), it is apparent that technology can get people killed.

We must put quality into our work because our work reflects the quality of life in others.

----------

In the future we will all be our own brands.

Cherish each experience and be willing to share your lessons from those experiences.

We need more stories from people. Regular people. Not less.

Share your stories. The world is desperate for it.

----------

People with their myriad of experiences, each priceless and irreplaceable, do not realize the value they have when they share a condensed and focused thought for the sake of helping others.

If you are reading this, understand that there is a person out there that is desperately seeking answers and that your clearly focused and well thought out answers can guide them to the end of their current suffering.

When in doubt, speak up.
