An easy answer for those that have to answer the question ‚ÄúDescribe America‚Äù

One answer is Bob Ross.

American optimism, respect and appreciation for nature and natural creatures, willingness to accept mistakes and to work with those mistakes to produce something better, and general agreeableness (‚Äúlet‚Äôs you and I make a deal‚Äù)

Bob Ross is an excellent cultural export to other countries abroad.

In fact, I advocate that all naturalization classes for American citizenship start with an episode of Bob Ross, subtitled in the relevant language.

From a business perspective, it is not a bad thing to be a generalist of information if you can accurately predict trends.

It is a bad thing, however, if you are a specialist and you‚Äôve lost track of the trends in your industry.

One way to make sure you stay relevant is to continue being in service to others. Maybe hang out with new people and be a good listener. Buy someone lunch. Donate to a charitable cause (after researching adequately)

Most of advertising is mumbo jumbo.

But the A/B split test is real.

Take one advertisement and see how it compares to the results of another.

This test as a rule would reject 99% of advertisements out there because most advertisements have no ability to prove validity.

This is why people are handing you samples of beauty supplies at the mall. They give you something free, and they can count the number of people that purchase the product after having taken the sample.

----------

The subscription model is great because you‚Äôd really have to commit an egregious violation for people to cancel. People are willing to give the benefit of the doubt.

Now you think of a business model that relies on a subscription. Could be the next big thing!

This article seems to have lost its self awareness. Normalizing work from home is one of the few high impact solutions towards a more organic, grass-fed and whole-grain world.

It took me 32 years to learn this:

Lighten up. Overly serious people are a drag. Dale Carnegie‚Äôs first rule to winning friends and influencing people is to smile.

Smile today. Lighten up. Life‚Äôs too short not to leave behind meaningful and happy experiences.

Lighten up and tell a really bad joke and then laugh about it.

Instead of feeling embarrassed about that one time in your life, go ahead and laugh about it.

Lighten up. Smile. üôÇ

I think it‚Äôs really important to be sure to grow your personal social networks as you do your professional social networks.

You don‚Äôt want wake up one day and realize you know very little of your parents, siblings or loved ones.

We did the right thing by moving to automobile vehicles for the main form of transportation for people.

Horses can be finicky, easily spooked, and downright dangerous to inexperienced riders.

Millions of horses were killed in World War I. (Citation needed. Nevermind ‚Äì just Google‚Äôd it) Soft number at around 8 million horses.

Automobiles are faster, can carry dozens, and are generally safer. Also, automobiles don‚Äôt require hay.

Technological improvements are for people, the animals, and the natural world around us. Technological advancements can help us to move closer to a world free from suffering. We should design products with that idea in mind.

The top 4 websites are Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

All of which are essentially advertising platforms.

Do I enjoy the fruit of the free services of these sites? Sure, yes, I can have my cake and eat it too.

But why can‚Äôt I help but feel I‚Äôm just staring at a grocery shelf filled with potato chips?
