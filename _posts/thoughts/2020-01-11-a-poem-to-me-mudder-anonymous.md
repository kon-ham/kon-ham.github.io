When my prayers were poorly said,

Who Tucked me in my widdle bed,

And spanked me till me ass was red?

Me Mudder.

Who took me from me cozy cot,

And put me on the ice-cold pot,

And made me pee if me could not?

Me Mudder.

And when the morning light had come,

And in me crib me'd dribble some,

Who wipe me tiny widdle bum?

Me Mudder.

Who would me hair soon gently part,

And hug me gently to her heart,

And sometimes squeeze me till me fart?

Me Mudder.

Who looked at me wid eyebrows knit,

And damn'ed nearly threw a fit

When in me Sunday clothes me shit?

Me Mudder.
