title: Power in Gentleness

I stayed with an elderly couple for some time during my short career as an early childhood educator.

That experience was priceless for me.

They were in their 70s and 80s and they both demonstrated an enormous power in their demeanor. It was a power that was grounded not in insecurity and the need to constantly flex that power but rather in their quiet humility. Their power lied in their dignity and steadfast faith in their walk.

I've never before been in such a presence of people and being able to observe them and to experience such a presence was a priceless experience.

Modern people seem to have an air of insecurity and ungroundedness that makes us feel fluttery - a type of presence that suggest that even the quietest whisper of the wind would blow us away.

Why is that?

Seeing that elderly couple I decided that it would be my goal to become similar to them one day. 

I'm actually rather quite insecure and without a strong foundation. I wonder if part of this is that I am an immigrant - I can speak my heritage's language but I am functionally illiterate. Furthermore, I don't know my original nation's deep history and culture. I know part of my identity is that of being a Korean and intuitively understanding the emotional context of what it means to be Korean, I still feel a sense of disconnect from my country.

This is why I am glad to be part of the West, despite its current faults and failures. There is a greater sense of bond and connection that transcends racial and cultural heritage.

I want to one day be strong in my humility, quietness and meekness. 

A wise and confident ruler does not have insecurity about who he is - therefore there is no need to constantly demonstrate that power. He simply is.

I think the West needs to recall what it is like to wield the power of meekness. It's such a strong force - I believe that it transform and heal the many woes of our lives and of the people we live with.

Here's to meekness - may it fully and powerfully overwhelm you.
