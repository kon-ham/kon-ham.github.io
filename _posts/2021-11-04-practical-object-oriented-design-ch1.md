title: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, Ch. 1

## On Ruby

Ruby is a great language to learn to program. In fact, because of it's accessibility, it can be easy to write code that lacks design or understanding of object oriented programming. Ruby will still function without this knowledge.

In Ruby, all objects come pre-equipped with behavior because all objects inherit from its class.

And since those classes are also objects that inherit from another class, we have an enormous amount of flexibility in creating data-types or behaviors.

Classes themselves can be thought of as blueprints for our objects. Within each class is a set of methods and attributes that each instantiation of a class will inherit.

Instantiation itself is the act of creating a new instance of an object.

## What is the different between an object-oriented language and a procedural programming language?

Compared to procedural programming languages, Ruby is different because there are no data-types, only objects. Procedural programming variables can store only one data-type. In Ruby, because what's being stored in a variable is an object, that variable can store many different types of data in a single object.

In fact, not only can Ruby store multiple data-types with each variable, but it can also store behavior. In procedural programming languages, behavior and data-types are separated and predefined.

Furthermore, new data-types cannot be created in procedural programming languages. Neither can new operations.
