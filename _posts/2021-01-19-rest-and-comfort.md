<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Eat without thanks and drink without peace
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  An empty belly filled nausea and regret
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Eat with gratefulness and humility
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Fullness that lasts, not overwhelming
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Drink with moderation and friendship
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Lasting memories drip warmly down
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Remember, even if it was not your own story
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  That once long ago
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  We toiled in bondage
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Yet now gifted &#8211; a hope for freedom
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Enjoy thankfully and remember
</p>
