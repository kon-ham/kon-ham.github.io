title: Summarizing Three Months of Interviewing
---
Having recently accepted a job offer, I thought I might share key takeaways from my three months of interviewing after graduating from Turing School of Software and Design. Below are my thoughts organized by category. I hope this helps anyone currently now in the job search.

## On you and leverage

You have a beautiful story to tell. Your past experiences and skills (even if you are literally just coming out of highschool with no prior work experience) have an enormous capacity to contribute to a company. You must have the audacity to believe it and the insight to look into yourself and pull from it a meaningful narrative in which you share to others.

Neediness is lame. You are valuable (as a junior developer) - the company either recognizes it (with your effort and dutiful presentation) or they don't. Be respectful. Be professional. Be thankful. Be kind. Be excited at the potential to work for a company. But be OK if they can't see it or if they want someone else.

## Techniques to interview well

Vibe check yourself. I had a routine before I interviewed that helped me to get "in the zone".

First, I did my hygiene stuff, styled my hair - the nice things you do when you want to feel good about yourself and want to look your best.

I had a light meal before to make sure I had energy to display to my interviewers.

I lit a candle so that my room smelled nice and cozy. You might be surprised about a candle. It can relax you and make you feel at home in your home.

5 - 10 minutes before my interview I turned on Photo Booth and watched cute and funny animal videos. I used Photo Booth to watch myself smile and laugh at the silly animal videos to get in the practice of smiling and to remind myself that *smiling is beautiful*. Sometimes I'd listen to music to help me feel determined to do a good job regardless of my circumstance.

When it's game time, be sure to smile, wave, present yourself as a positive and cheerful human being. Thank them for their time from the beginning.

They will ask you to introduce yourself. They may even ask you to tell them about yourself. You should have your "about me" pitch down. You should be able to pitch your "about me" in your sleep.

Modify your pitch depending on if they want a 30 second presentation or a 2 minute presentation. You must master your pitch. This is your headline. In advertising, bad headlines will cause people to skip over your content. Master your about me pitch. Again, master your about me pitch.

When they ask you a question - it is important to remember: *you don't have to answer immediately*.

Thank them for asking the question. Ask for a moment to think about their question. Use that time to breath and relax. If it helps, tell them you're trying to relax a bit because you're a bit nervous about interviewing. This is a good test. If they're not receptive to how you're feeling, you probably don't want to be working there.

After answering each question, ask your interviewer: "Was that the answer you were looking for?"

This question has saved me many times over. In your mind you may have answered adequately but sometimes the interviewer themselves are not really great at asking questions - you must be able to ask if your answer was sufficient in order to be sure you are giving them what they are looking for.

You must find out what they are looking for. Then you must give it to them.

You want your interviewers saying "yes" as much as possible. So after every question ask a variation of *"was that the answer that you were looking for?"*. In doing so you also convey that you are open to feedback and reception. This indicates that you're probably an alright person to work with since nobody is perfect.

Make an impact. This is vague, sorry. But make an impact. Connect with your interviewers. Share stories from your path that are relevant to your interview questions. Laugh. Smile. Try your best to make good use of an uncomfortable situation since interviewing sucks for both parties. Your interviewers will thank you for it. Might as well give everybody a good show!

When it comes to making an impact, shoot for personalized rejection letters. When you're making an impact with a team they will also impact you. This means that when they reject you they will probably break your heart. But that's life! Be open to heartbreak and hopefully you have a group of people to commiserate with.

Be open to thinking critically: think about how you were perceived by others (do I need to work on my presentation skills?), how you communicate and follow up with communication (do you handle feedback well? Do you give good feedback?), how you connect emotionally with others, how well you convey gratitude and thanks to people you meet in your life.

After being open to thinking critically about these things, try to improve as best as you can. But importantly, be kind to yourself. You will improve over time as you keep interviewing.

## The anxiety

It will never go away. You just get better at juggling those feelings. Eventually you become battle-hardened and the anxiety will help you to perform and to be victorious over your pitiful enemies.

I still feel like I'm going to die when I interview. And in a way I do die - I resolve to myself that I can only do my best and that I cannot control the rest of the process. In a way that's kind of like death as you release an aspect of control over your life.

I promise you - each time you interview you will get stronger. Be willing to dive into each opportunity to interview so that you can get stronger.

## Technical Interview

Get used to having to speak technically. You must use the language. It should be a good mixture of utilizing technical terminology while being able to convey those terms to a technological luddite. If you need to, try practicing explaining RESTful to your grandma. You should be able to explain concepts at a high level while also introducing and utilizing the person listening to you to industry terminology.

## LeetCode

You need to be able to code on the fly. Get two or three people together and organize a Zoom meeting where each person solves a problem through Exercism or LeetCode while the rest of the people watch. The person solving the problem must not only solve the problem but also adequately communicate their thought process. Get used to the pressure.

## Take home challenges

Time box it. Ask your interviewer what the expectation of time boxing is for the project. Be OK with doing your best and moving on. You want a company to look at what you do, notice it is incomplete or could be better, and instead say "We can work with this person." As much as possible, don't work for free.

I had an experience where I spent an entire week on a take home challenge. Looking back it was foolish of me to do so because nothing came of the interview process and I wasted a week worried about a company that ended up ghosting me.

## The results and rejection

Sometimes you will do your best and it will not be enough. There will be someone that was marginally better than you. Your personality will not be enough. Your tech skills will not be enough.

No big deal! It's really important never to forget - **there are always more opportunities than you will know what to do with**. Keep searching. Thank everyone for their time and try not to mull over rejections for more than 2 or 3 days.

Ultimately, you want to put on a good show but your ideal case is a situation where a company *wants you*. Believe that there is a company that is simply dying to hire you. I found one. There are countless companies that don't know about you that want you bad. Real bad. It's up to you to find that opportunity and to make it yours. Keep this in mind as you continue your search.

## Salaries

They are all over the place. I've interviewed for (similar) positions that offered anywhere from 55k to up to 137k. If money is your only objective, the sky is the limit.

## Negotiations

There is always wiggle room. I was offered a salary + a sign on bonus. I was told there was no wiggle room. A quick reply of "I want to thank you for all of your help and the work you've done for me to offer this generous compensation package. Thank you for that. To be sure I am covering all of my bases...is there any wiggle room considering there is no wiggle room?"

Asking nicely resulted in an increase of a few thousand extra to my sign on bonus.

Always ask, even if you feel embarrassed about it. If you need to, tell them "I'm really embarrassed about this, but can you...?"

## Money is not the only metric

I ultimately accepted a role with a company that I felt I could learn from - not only as a developer but as an entrepreneur. I probably could have found a company that offered more in terms of dollars but in terms of salaries, I consider the difference between where I am now and other possibilities as the cost of tuition to learn from a great team.

## Interview more in order to find out what you really want

You may not know what you want. It may be that it is because you have not interviewed enough with places. After a few interviews I began to get a gut instinct for companies. I began to have a gut feeling about where I would thrive and where I would be just another number.

If you don't know what you want from a company - it might be because you haven't interviewed enough. Something to consider.

## It will happen

This is important. Give up comparing yourself to your cohort members. The more you do the more you will poison your energy levels. You are on your own journey. Embrace it.
