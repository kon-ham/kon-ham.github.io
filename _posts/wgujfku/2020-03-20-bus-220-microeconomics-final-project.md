  Netflix is a company founded by Reed Hastings in 1999. The company originally  
started with a mail-by-order DVD rental service. (“How Netflix got started”, 2009)  
Although Netflix still provides this service, it is possibly most well known for delivering  
entertainment content through the internet. This service is called “streaming” and  
involves consumers being able to instantly view content with the ability to pause, rewind,  
and fast forward video or audio. This streaming service is made possible with internet  
access and differs from conventional television in that the user decides what program to  
view.  

  Although Netflix continues to provide DVD rental services as well as producing  
new entertainment content to provide consumers, I have decided to choose this streaming  
service as the point of research for this project because of the popularity of Netflix’s  
streaming service.  

  The following are the three determinants of demand for Netflix’s streaming  
service: First, price of the subscription service. Netflix currently charges $9.99 for its HD  
service and $7.99 for its regular service. One reason for price being a large determinant  
of demand was the controversy of Netflix’s streaming service being raised $1.00. And as  
a result of the second determinant of demand, consumer expectations, Netflix struggled  
against consumer backlash with the increase of price. Although backlash was imminent,  
so were the increases. But the increases in price don’t seem to have reduced the overall  
number of subscriptions of customers. (“Analyzing Netflix's”, 2016) Finally, the third  
determinant of demand is consumer taste. Consumers tend to have preferences for the  
shows they watch or types of genres they prefer.

  Competitors of Netflix have capitalized  
on this and have created streaming services to cater specifically to consumers who have  
desires in specific niche markets, like, for example, Bloomberg’s streaming service  
catered directly to those interested in business affairs. (“Analyzing Netflix's”, 2016)  
According to the previous determinants of demand, the streaming of service of  
Netflix appears to be an inelastic demand. The number of subscribers has actually  
increased despite the increase in price. (“The Impact Of Netflix's”, 2014) And part of this  
may have less to do with price and more to do with consumer expectations as well as  
consumer taste. Netflix has been increasingly producing its own content as a result of the  
higher prices content producers have been charging Netflix the rights to stream their  
content on Netflix’s platform. And as a result of this, Netflix has been producing content  
that has been exclusive to Netflix. Consumers now must decide if the exclusive content  
on Netflix is worth the increase in monthly price. And of course, it appears to be that  
consumers are happy with the content Netflix offers. And with the data collection that  
Netflix obsessively hoards and analyzes, Netflix creates more exclusive shows that  
appear to be irresistible to its monthly subscribers. (Bulygo, 2013) <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

(Pelisson, 2017)  
  The market structure of Netflix is most like a monopolistic competition. There are  
many firms which sell a service, in this case streaming, and that service cannot easily be  
differentiated between each firm. In this case, many of the movies and TV shows offered  
on one firm’s service are also offered on another firm’s service. But because of this lack  
of differentiation between the firms, these companies that offer streaming services now  
offer exclusive content that is featured only on each of the company’s services. Although  
the barriers to entry, in this case, consist of being in the millions of dollars, it is relatively  
easy for production companies to create their own streaming service. Hulu, for example,  
is a result of “a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company’s Disney/ABC TV  
Group, Twenty-First Century Fox’s Fox Broadcasting Company and Comcast's NBC  
Universal Television Group”. (“Analyzing Netflix's”, 2016) In this case here, the  
strategic alliance between these companies makes the creation of a streaming service and  
company a relatively low-cost option. (“Analyzing Netflix's”, 2016) 

  And interestingly enough, Netflix draws from its massive source of analytics and  
data to create targeted advertisements to draw audiences into its original content shows.  
(Katai, 2017) This means that theoretically, it can draw in audiences into shows they  
would not originally have interest in, if the targeted advertisements could create a draw  
based upon the targeted person’s preference in sex, age, and interests.  
Netflix is slowly moving away from the monopolistic competition market  
structure due to the fact that Netflix is continually expanding its creation of original  
content. Had Netflix continued only to offer a streaming service as its sole source of  
revenue, competitors would have cut Netflix out of the market by creating its own direct  
streaming service. And furthermore, consumers would have a harder time differentiating  
between the firms and the services. But because Netflix produces exclusive content,  
consumers have an easier time differentiating between the firms but possibly a more  
difficult time choosing between the firms as a result of conflict of interests. 

  
  The three recommendations I would make to Netflix are this: First, while  
continuing to produce original content, increase the prices again. Offer excellent content  
and services in return for the higher price to justify to consumers that Netflix remains the  
undisputed champion in streaming services and content creation. And as Netflix  
continues down this direction, Netflix should move from streaming service as the  
delivery method and to focus entirely on content creation as the means to differentiate  
itself from its competitors. I justify this suggestion based upon the graph I’ve created  
above that suggests the price of Netflix is to a certain degree, inelastic. The recent price  
increases of Netflix, while vocally many consumers groaned against this increase, still  
did not cause enough of Netflix’s consumers to cancel their monthly subscription. And I  
believe this is a result of Netflix’s continuation to create original content. This content is  
exclusive to Netflix and cannot be streamed on other streaming platforms like Hulu. 

  
  If Netflix wanted additional revenue, I would also suggest the creation of  
supplementary products. One example would be the implementation of a social network  
interface to Netflix’s streaming service. In this service Netflix would allow for their  
customers to connect with each other – to share, to “like”, and to use Netflix as a medium  
to meet new people. This would be a totally unique service that would set Netflix apart  
completely. This is a great way to enter into alternative markets to take from people who  
would not ordinarily use Netflix for social media. And considering that Netflix is  
sometimes broadcasted on a TV, Netflix could also introduce a proprietary keyboard that  
works as a remote as well as a microphone device. There is not a platform that allows this  
service. It would take little investment to create a social-media element to this and would  
justify the higher cost of Netflix. There are many people in relationships that are  
currently separated due to job relocations and so on. Giving opportunities for couples to  
watch movies together and to communicate while the movie goes on gives Netflix the  
opportunity to offer emotional and sentimental value to the consumer. This is priceless in  
itself and customers would justify a $17.99 price if it meant that these consumers could  
keep in touch with loved ones. 

  
  Second, while producing original content, I would suggest to Netflix to offer a  
free subscription option to lure new customers into Netflix’s ecosystem. So this means  
that Netflix negotiates with advertisers to pay for content distribution to consumers while  
at the same time, Netflix continues to use the data analytics from the viewing habits of  
consumers to target specific ads related to Netflix’s original content; from there to then  
try to lure new consumers into purchasing Netflix’s “premium” access, which would be  
anywhere from $15.99 to $17.99. I suggest this based off of not only price demand  
determinant, but also tastes as a demand determinant. The higher price will most certainly  
be unpopular since Netflix originally started at a $7.99 monthly subscription. Customers  
have a luxury to compare that original price to my suggested new price: $15.99-17.99.  
That’s around a 125% increase in price. So naturally there would be controversy. But I  
believe that the creation of original content would change consumer demand would not  
change the consumer demand but would rather shift the entire demand curve to the right.  
In order to further finance these costs, I also suggest strategic alliances with  
production companies, especially newer production companies that are willing and  
desperate to breakthrough into the market. So, signing new production companies into a  
contract in which Netflix offers to stream the content in exchange for ad revenue and data  
collection from the streaming of the new production companies’ content. Streaming on  
the Netflix platform is sure to generate viewership so it works out for new production  
companies. Since Netflix is giving free traffic to these production companies, it costs  
Netflix only the bandwidth cost. That cost is offset by the revenue of the advertisements  
that will play on top of these breakthrough shows. And Netflix can create further assets  
through the data and analytics that are mined from the result of viewership that comes  
from the “free subscription” of Netflix. So it is a win-win situation for everyone,  
especially for those who feel they’ve not the ability to justify paying $17.99 in  
subscription costs. 

  
  So the free subscription is a matter of maintain strategic alliances between the  
production companies who don’t have the revenue to create their own streaming services  
and the advertising companies as well as the scouting of new production companies who  
are willing to sacrifice current revenue for viewership now. This can be an avenue for  
countless amounts of “indie” or independent content creators to find a wider viewership.  
This even means that these people no longer have to upload their content through  
YouTube and instead Netflix can take a portion of YouTube’s production community  
away from it and drive it instead to Netflix. 

  
  It is impossible to correctly predict future consumer tastes and preferences all of  
the time. That’s why investing in future production companies who are independent and  
usually don’t have the cash flow to create their own content streaming service would be  
beneficial to Netflix. Netflix can then take this data from the viewership of these smaller  
production companies and then turn around and create its own original content that can  
compete with these independent content creators. And with the higher cost of  
subscription, Netflix can then focus entirely on creating original content. Netflix must  
focs on content creation as a result of larger production companies like Disney, ABC and  
so on creating their own streaming services. This means that they are not likely to share  
content with Netflix, or will charge higher prices of access to Netflix because these large  
production firms are in competition with Netflix. They want to succeed over Netflix so  
there is no incentive for these companies to play along nicely with Netflix. If Netflix  
were to simply sink back to streaming as a service as their only source of revenue, it will  
fall into the monopolistic competition market structure and will eventually be forced out  
of the industry by price. 

  
  Finally, I suggest that Netflix not ignore the domestic market. There are still  
millions more Americans who do not have Netflix subscription access as a result of the  
technological divide. I suggest that Netflix create a device that plugs into a TV with  
RGB, VGA, and HDMI inputs. This allows for people who do not have access to internet  
streaming devices to plug into Netflix’s content environment. Now, since these people  
usually are not tech-savvy it would take a mailing campaign with a personalized letter as  
well as a detailed but simple “How-To” instructional on how to install the device and  
how to pay for the service. Even better would be a way to provide access to content  
without the use of internet – perhaps through a satellite connection. This same technology  
could be used to gain entry into the market of consumers who are international but  
without stable access to the internet. I believe that Netflix is expanding into the  
international market and as a result under appreciating the domestic market.
