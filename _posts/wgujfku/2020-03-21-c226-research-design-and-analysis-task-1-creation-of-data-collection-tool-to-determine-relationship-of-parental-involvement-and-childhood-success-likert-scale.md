A Written Project Presented to the Faculty of the Teachers College  
of Western Governors University 

Education-Related Research Topic  
I am attempting to collect data on whether or not parental involvement correlates with future success of a young child, indicated by academic success in college. I have interest in this topic because I intend to start my own day care center, and along with myself and my fellow teachers, parents will also be part of the stakeholders involved in the future success of these young children. This collection of data will be hypothetical to me, as I am not currently involved in an educational field nor do I have the participants willing nor able to be able to extract data from.  
Participants  
I am looking for parental involvement in the lives of adults that have a college degree. Demographics of my target population will be any race, any age, any sex. To maintain geographic relevancy, I will only be seeking college degree holding adults that have received their degrees in the United States. Furthermore, I am looking for college degrees that are regionally accredited. I will not accept national accreditation as a valid form of accreditation. This is not because I value regional accreditation higher than national accreditation, but because focusing on regional accreditation allows me to narrow the amount of experiences my target population has had so as to reduce the total amount of variables of influence the students may have had.  
Purpose of the Data Collection Instrument  
The purpose of this instrument is to provide quantitative data on the various influences a parent has had on an adult that has graduated college through the use of a questionnaire. I want to utilize a questionnaire because I am looking to determine how much of an impact a parent has had on an adult from the perspective of the respondent, to measure his or her values relating to the impact a parent has had on their lives.  
Type of Data Collected  
I will utilize a questionnaire to determine the correlational relationship between parental influence and future college success. Because the specific type of data I am trying to extract is from adults looking back in their own lives from 10 to 40 years ago, I realize there are limitations to the type of data collection that I have. That is, that memory can be hazy. I will utilize a Likert scale to determine to what degree an adult may have felt parent influences had affected their lives instead of a binary yes or no response, which may skew my results, because of the matter of the amount of influence being a complicated mixture of yes and no. The questionnaire will address various types of influences a parent can exert over their child, like the amount of food insecurity a person may have felt growing up, how much he or she felt their parents were a part of their early school life, and whether or not there the respondent felt a pressure to succeed academically from the parents.  
Ethical Issues and Process to Address  
The first ethical issue that I want to address is the issue of research misconduct, specifically, fabricating my research results to support a theory that I may have, that being that parental influence has some sort of an effect on the ability for a person to graduate college. Fortunately, because I am not actually administering my data collection instrument and am only developing this for my class, I have significantly less bias towards manipulating my results. However, I can be mindful of various factors that can influence a person towards publishing fraudulent results, like the pressure to maintain a grant or continued funding.  
Secondly, because this data is does gauge personal history of the respondents, it could be considered sensitive information. Because of this, I want to be sure that the information remains confidential and, on a need-to-know basis. I can maintain ethical honesty by informing my respondents the purpose of the questionnaire and how the data will be applied to my research topic. Furthermore, I can inform my respondents the extent to which the data will be shared with other people, and ensuring that the information will only be shared with stakeholders related to my research topic.

A Respondent’s Questionnaire to Determine the Levels of Influence a Parent May Have Had on Their Ability to Succeed in College

Directions: Your response is requested for the following 8 questions. This questionnaire utilizes a Likert scale to determine to what degree you have felt your parents have been involved in your early childhood life to young adulthood to determine whether or not that influence has a correlation with your ability to succeed and graduate college. A Likert Scale simply means that you have a total of 5 potential items to choose from for each question. Circle your answer. See the following example below:

(A1) Politics are welcome topic in a dinner conversation.  
Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>There is no right or wrong answer. The purpose of this study is to determine your perspective of how much influence your parents may have had over your academic success and to understand its relationship.  Your response is confidential and will only be shared with the researcher and stakeholders involved in this research project. 
Finally, do not write your name on the questionnaire, as it will be an anonymous questionnaire.</code></pre>

Let’s begin.
