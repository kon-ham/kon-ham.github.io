title: Who Recognizes You (Poetry)

Arise, servant of the twilight!
Still dark - heavy is the sleep in your eyes
and heavy are your feet, varicose are your veins.
Your body aches and your spirit turns,
a grindstone of flesh and soul.
Your blood, sweat, and tears are consumed by the fire
and ashe is all that is left.
This is my purpose, this is my place, you say.
May I die so that they may live, you say.
From the work of your hands
the little children eat of your bread
and are nourished for generations to come.
