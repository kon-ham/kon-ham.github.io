<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Sometimes I see a glimpse of you
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  as a shadow slips through my hands,
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  and I pray you would be strong,
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  with resilience and compassion written on your face
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  A mark on your forehead
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  to take you through all trials and pain.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Know that hope must be held on to
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  and that rest must be had
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  under the shade of the eagle&#8217;s wings
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  And when you&#8217;ve strengthened your grip
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  from suffering made strong
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  And your tears wiped from your eyes
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  On that day
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  I too will then rest
</p>
