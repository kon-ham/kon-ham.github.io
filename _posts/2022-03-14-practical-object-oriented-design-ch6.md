title: Summary of "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby", Ch. 6
---
This is a summary of Metz’s “Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby". That means there is no idea here that is original to my own - I am summarizing the material for my learning and in case you might want a quick summary. All credit goes to Metz.
