title: Summary of "Becoming a Technical Leader", Ch. 1
---

This is a summary of Weinberg's "Becoming a Technical Leader". That means there is no idea here that is original to my own - I am summarizing the material for my learning and in case you might want a quick summary. All credit goes to Weinberg.

## Being an Effective Leader

To be an effective leader you must be able to tolerate a large amount of models and switch from one to another as needed.

No one person uses only one model 100% of the time. 

Leading people requires that you relinquish control over their lives. It is a process that is being responsive to people, giving them choices and leaving them in control.

Think of the way a gardener empowers seed - the gardener does not force the seed to grow but rather taps the dormant power that lies within in the seed. (Weinberg)

The takeaway from our gardener example is that leadership involves being creative and productive through other people. It is about creating an environment rather than being focused on threats and rewards.

## On Innovation

Innovation is concerned with redefining a task or the way a task is done. (Weinberg)

Some models of perception involving leadership assume perfect understanding of a problem - because of this innovation is filtered out and ignored because of the inherent bias in assuming the way we view a problem is without lack. 

## Models (Organic vs. Linear)

Weinberg introduces the reader to two different models of leadership: Organic vs. Linear

### Organic vs. Linear on Events

The linear model views that one effect stems from one cause, and vice versa. It works well for understanding simple events.

Linear models have difficulty understanding complex events, including complex events involving people, viewing that there is one right answer. 

The organic model implements systems thinking in that event X is the result of hundreds of other factors, including passage of time. It is comfortable in complex situations we do not fully understand, viewing that there are many possible explanations (which can all be simultaneously true) until more information arises to make a choice. 

Organic models can have difficulty in making a decision and the bearer of this model must be OK with making mistakes. 

### Organic vs. Linear on People

Linear models view people in categories. It is useful in dealing with people quickly and efficiently (ordering coffee without pondering the server's uniqueness and individuality). It views motivation through a system of threats and rewards through a leader.

Organic models view people in their sameness plus differences. This means that it sees uniqueness in people. It attemps to find a common basis for working together in complex solutions. Leaders try to get people in touch with their inner harmony.

### Organic vs. Linear on Relationships

Linear models view roles than people; a boss instead of a leader exerting influence. This model allows for planning of large scale operations. It is not very useful in one-on-one relationships. Views power in the role rather than in the relationship. When duty calls, an individual invokes authority or yields to another's. Resulting emotions tend to be fear, anger, aggression, and envy.

Organic models view that the relationship is between one unique person to another unique person. It is useful in one-on-one relationships. Problem solving branches out to a solution in which everyone benefits. The common emotion in this model is the joy of discovery. Unfortunately sometimes joy of discovery is so fun nothing actually gets done.

### Organic vs. Linear on Change

Linear models hold that change must be orderly and that only one thing must happen at a time. This works well in a stable solution. It is bad in changing situations. Linear models tend to want to stop change when change occurs outside of the scope of our linear model. It can view change and people changing as being a bad thing.

Organic models view that it is impossible to only change one thing. It welcomes change in order to grow. It views that growth is a natural process by which potential is realized - it is a seed that can grow into a beautiful flower.

Another way to refer to organic models is to refer to them as seed models.
