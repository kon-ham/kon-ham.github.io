title: Summary of "Becoming a Technical Leader", Ch. 3
---

This is a summary of Weinberg's "Becoming a Technical Leader". That means there is no idea here that is original to my own - I am summarizing the material for my learning and in case you might want a quick summary. This means that much of this is either word for word or my attempt at summarizing an idea. All credit goes to Weinberg.

## The 3 ways of innovation by problem-solving leaders
Successful leaders employ problem solving in their leadership. They focus on the process of innovation. The three ways of innovation are:
- Understanding the problem
- Managing the flow of ideas
- Maintaining quality

## Understanding the problem
We must read the specifications very clearly. Success often depends on minuscule differences in problem definitions. 

We need an ability to see things at a big picture level but that big picture often turns on one little detail. Problem solving leaders recognize and pay attention to this so encourage your teammates to read the specifications very carefully. (Weinberg)

This reading process is the consumption of information but encouraging others to do it is leadership by motivation. "No one pair of eyes is sufficiently reliable when a few words may make a four million dollar difference." (Weinberg)

Effective problem solving leaders know how to organize the environment so that all eyes are operating at full power.

Resolve arguments by referring back to the original problem. Unless and until all team members have a common understanding of the problem much the effort to solve the problem is wasted energy.

Effective problem solving leaders are able to know whether the argument is based on a difference in problem definition or a difference in solution method. (Weinberg)

Seek clarification and additional information about the specifications from the customer.

Understandably not everyone wants to interact with people and many people want to immediately start working with what they have (in terms of technical specifications) but sometimes a trivial interaction with a person can really pay off.

Once you've started, refer back to the specifications after work has proceeded for a while, when the implications of the requirements can be better understood (Weinberg)

Complex problems are never understood right away but we make assume we've understood them. This is dangerous so constantly encourage re-examination of assumptions about the problem.

Effective leaders build continuous testing of their own understanding into their work. (Weinberg)

These people are self-confident but realistic about their own intellectual limitations. (Weinberg)

## Managing the flow of ideas
Ideas are at the core of problem solving leadership. These ideas are what enable us to go from an understanding of the problem to a high quality solution. There is a balance to these ideas. Too few and there are no solutions. Too many and there is chaos.

Without leadership even technical experts can quarrel. When there is effective management of these ideas, we can craft a successful problem solving team. (Weinberg)

Here are 12 typical actions successful problem solving leaders use to manage those flows of ideas:
- *Contribute a clever idea to the team*. This assumes the view that not many ideas are truly new. Weinberg says more important than a clever idea is "creating an environment where the right idea for solving the problem will be recognized when it comes along."
- *Encourage copying of useful ideas*. Problem solving leaders copy. Most good ideas are copies of other good ideas. The art is in searching for other context to which an idea can be applied. "Problem solving leaders not interested in doing again what has already been done well, by themselves or someone else." (Weinberg)
- *Elaborate on an idea that a teammate contributed*. No idea is perfect when formed; even copied ideas must be adapted to those new circumstances. Most problem solving leaders spend most of their time perfecting ideas to proposing them (Weinberg)
- *Drop one's idea in favor of an idea that a team wants to develop - refuse to let an idea drop until everyone understands it*. Large problems require people working harmoniously. The need to work in a team can work against you as there is a social pressure to conform with the majority. This can be bad if the team is stuck on a bad idea!
  - Learn to know when you're being egotistical with your idea.
  - Hold on to your idea even when the team is going the opposite direction.
- *Resist time pressure - take time to listen when others explain their ideas*. Often times good ideas actually get dropped under time pressure - even though sometimes taking the time to understand that idea can far outweigh the cost of understanding that idea. It can also outweigh trying to understand a hundred bad ideas.
  - People tend to lose dedication to a project if their idea wasn't heard.
  - Ultimately, projects that have all ideas heard tend to complete faster. Even if those ideas are inapplicable.
- *Test ideas contributed by other people*. In any given situation you have many ideas. Many of those ideas will not be useful. This is normal. But which ideas are useful?
- *Withhold quick criticism of teammates ideas, in order to keep the ideas flowing*. Testing is important. Hardly any idea is so dangerous that we cannot consider them given our initial reaction to them.
- *When criticizing an idea, make it clear you are criticizing the idea and not the person*. Problem solving leaders know that not every idea is applicable - but they know even more so that every person is useful. Offer your criticisms in a caring way. Pay attention to the way you use your words. Criticize ideas, not people.
- *Test your own ideas before offering them*. Spewing a quantity of ideas does not make you a problem solving leader. Instead of spraying ideas, try offering ideas that are previously tested by you.
- *When time and labor are short, stop working on new ideas and pitch in*. There comes a time to do the work. If you don't have enough ideas by then the project won't finish. Put in the work.
- *Encourage the team to drop ideas that had succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation. Letting go of bad ideas can be hard let alone good ideas*. Even though problem solving leaders work in the realm of good ideas - every good idea has limitations.
- *Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for another part of the problem*. Weinberg says, actually "there are no bad ideas" - only ideas that are in the wrong place or time. Old ideas don't wear out. (Weinberg) A problem solving leader has great memory and an even better sense of timing.

## Maintaining Quality
Earlier we were told that we must understand the problem. This works if we are always building exactly what was specified. Chefs taste the food during preparation. Reexamine the specifications as you build. Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution. (Weinberg)

"Measuring true progress and quality sometimes seems a burden during a project, but good tools create an environment that makes quality control seem natural." (Weinberg)

So reexamine the specifications by taking a step back to refresh your perspective. Weinberg says sometimes the best tool in your ability to measure is to take a fresh perspective.

Problem solving leaders are able to see not only when a product is doomed but also to persuade others to accept doom before pouring more effort into a hopeless cause. (Weinberg)

Check ideas with the customer before you implement ideas. Customers are not always right but they are the ones that pay you. Weinberg supposes fewer projects would have been abandoned if their leaders built in some form of check in process with customers.

Problem solving leaders know how to restore morale when an idea collapses. Problem solving leaders do not accept failure and know how to keep things moving.

For an effective leader, in fact, when failure does occur, it's a "release from bondage from a fruitless idea, a release that renews the idea cycle and makes the process more productive than ever" (Weinberg)
