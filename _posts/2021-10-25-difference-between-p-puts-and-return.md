title: The (Super Short) Difference Between P, Puts, Print, and Return
---

### Summary:
Use `p` if you need your output to look more closely to what your Ruby code looks like.

Use `puts` if you need to output your value *and* create a new line afterwards.

Use `print` if you need to output your value *with no new line*.

Use `return` if you need to simply return a value without indicating a need for a visible output for your value.
