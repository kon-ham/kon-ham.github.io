The series is long. It&#8217;s absolutely a tour de force in the celebration of gore, violence, and hate. I finished it, despite the derogatory words eventually becoming tiresome to me.

I did have a thought on justice, though.

Ms. Demergue eventually does hang, but she hangs by Captain Mannix, who was to be the sheriff of the town of Red Rock where Ms. Demergue was to hang.

Though Mannix had not completed his ceremonies to be sworn in as a sheriff, he was appointed as &#8220;sheriff-to-be&#8221; by law or ordinance. 

Ms. Demergue was a diabolical woman. However, it would have been wrong to have enacted mob justice by killing her on the spot. Justice must be carried out by mandated authorities. When we have a rule-of-mob law, anarchy and injustice reigns. 

There must be order in this world, and in better times, those authorities placed above us must carry out justice, or all of society suffers.

Ms. Demergue did hang and it was done appropriately by Capt. Mannix. 

Even in a blood soaked room with corpses strewn about &#8211; order, structure, and even justice can be had, if we are willing to do things the right way.
