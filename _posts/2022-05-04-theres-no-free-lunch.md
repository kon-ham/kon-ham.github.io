title: There's no such thing as a free lunch

So I started an eBay store. For now, I won't share the store link as it's rather fragile right now.

But I spent about 2 hours listing 9 items. I think I did OK for my first time. 

It was tiring. Actually I felt great about finally starting to make some traction on my dreams to start an ecommerce shop but I learned that it takes hard work to start a business.

For years I had been wanting to start my own business but looking back, I made many excuses to getting started, and when I did start I quickly failed because I realized too late the lift was greater than I had expected.

This time though, whether I fail or not, I think I'm making progress because I can admit that the work is hard and that there is no such thing as a free lunch.

On top of starting this venture, I am still trying my best to keep up with Python (and documenting my progress) as well as doing the same for learning Swift.

Anything worth doing is tough - and then once you get it going it takes lots of work to keep that momentum going.

Starting any venture, even a business, is not glamorous. After I created my listings nobody congratulated me (though I did share my listings with some close friends and they were encouraging - thank you friends). 

But there is no praise in this. Only when you've done the dirty work and put in the blood, sweat, and tears do you start to get some passerbys that can look at the machine and be impressed with it.

I think overall that doing those listings today was a lesson for me - one lesson being that you must put in the work even when no one is watching. Then you must do it over and over again.

I think I can understand why most people would prefer to have a salaried job. It's easier! You do what's asked of you and when the clock hits the end of the day you can go home and relish doing whatever you'd like. No more responsibilities!

I'm not sure then why I am still greedy to start a business, whether small or big. I think it's because I'm ultimately insecure about things and I know that having a business helps me to weather the storm better than if I only had one source of income. I think the trade off to being salaried and having only one source of income is that you're one layoff away from losing everything.

I've seen my parents nearly lose everything more than once - it's a heart breaking thing to see and I sometimes think about how my parents must feel about being set back so many times.

I probably harbor a secret sense of anger towards people in charge that so easily dictate rules and laws that make it harder for people with businesses to operate. I'm being vague here and that's on purpose but everyone alive now is doing what they need to do in order to survive. Some are content with getting by and some don't have the privilege to make that choice.

My parents never had the opportunity to be content with getting by because they came to this country with no skill whatsoever. They could not speak the language so even basic jobs were out of their reach. They had to go into business for themselves and to deal with people that were willing to take advantage of the fact that my parents were not able to speak the language.

It's probably also in my heritage that I want to start and own my own businesses - my parents are slaves to their own business. I think this is unfortunate and sad at times but I think it's better to be a slave to yourself than to be a slave to others.

Anyways, those are my thoughts for the night.

Good night, everyone!
