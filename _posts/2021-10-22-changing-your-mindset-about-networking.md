title: Changing Your Mindset About Networking

Feeling Shy and Awkward About Networking?

Here's a way to change your mindset:

Networking is asking for directions.

Let's say you're lost. No GPS signal. But there's plenty of people around to ask for directions. They're all friendly enough people.

Choose one.

Obviously you do not approach this person and demand that they take you to your destination.

No. You want directions. You want to do the work yourself to get you where you need. You aren't asking that they chauffeur you to where you need to go. Asking for directions is always going to be a reasonable request. Nobody will deny this to you.

So you begin your reasonable proposition with a reasonable (and quick) greeting introducing yourself, your situation and how you're looking for someone that might have directions to take you where you want to go.

They themselves might not be locals to the area and will apologize and let you know that they actually are new to the area so they cannot help you.

No big deal. Thank them for their time. Say goodbye with hopes to maybe run into them later (after all, it was a pleasant enough experience, was it not?)

Now you try the next person.

The next person says actually, "I sort of know how to get there from here but not exactly. Here's what I know"

You take notes, you maybe share a funny moment or an anecdote but you tie up the loose ends and you thank them for their time, say your goodbyes and move on.

You repeat this process until you eventually reach your destination.

So don't feel awkward nor ashamed about asking for networking opportunities. Most people want to help. Asking for directions is always a reasonable request.

So try asking for some directions today. It's a great way to start your networking journey.
