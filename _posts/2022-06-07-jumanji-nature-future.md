I happened to come across Jumanji again and I was delighted to see how well the movie holds up in this day and age. If you want to know what I think, here it is:

10/10.

I really enjoyed the movie. Watching it again I noticed a few themes or takeaways. 

Here they are.

### What gets buried eventually resurfaces
There is no hiding anything. All of the things we hide away will eventually one day be resurfaced. We must not bury our past but rather face it and move on. Everything about Jumanji is about facing the difficult. One must face our obstacles and do what we can to overcome those obstacles. Ignoring the threat in front of you can get you killed - perhaps eaten by a crocodile.

Sometimes the best we can do is not to utterly destroy the obstacles, but rather choosing to live to fight another day.

### It is a total loss when we disconnect and become absent from the world
Alan is sucked into the world of Jumanji. He is trapped. Meanwhile, life continues for the worse. His father goes into utter despair and becomes despondent now that Alan is missing. When we disconnect from the world, others suffer. Others suffer when we engage in inappropriate actions, but it is a net loss to the world when we become absent. Our lives impact the lives of others, whether we know it or not. Only in the world of Jumanji are we able to see the utter consequences of a single missing person.

### Whether you like it or not, you have a past and an identity
Alan is bullied because he is a Parish. The other boys are jealous of the Parish wealth so they relentlessly bully him. Alan resent being a target and in an misguided effort begins to hate his identity and past. Our modern society tells us that we are free to choose our own identity. It says that we can choose to be whoever we want to be. This is wrong. We do not have a choice in our identity. We have a past. We have a family history. 

Do you have a family history you are not happy with or you'd rather not associate with? The reality is that you cannot change that. However, you are not doomed to repeat your past. You can take what you have now and improve upon it. You can till the hard soil to make it a supple soil from which many beautiful things can take root and grow. But you cannot do this running from that identity. Alan realizes as he speaks to a young boy, Peter, that though Alan spent decades in a jungle, he still ended up being like his father. 

### Nature actively works against humanity - and it wasn't meant to be like this
One time long ago humanity lived with nature in peace and cooperation. Humans were able to freely eat of all the fruits that nature had to offer. Dangerous animals now once came to humanity when humanity called its name. Even the atmosphere works against man - as once upon a time, humans did not sweat. Sweat is a reminder that nature works against us. 

Still yet there is a mission between humanity and nature. Humanity's purpose is to rule benevolently over all of nature, to be its greatest and most worthy caretaker. And nature was to respond in perfect harmony to humanity's rule. Yet now we have jungles and animals and atmospheric conditions that will kill humans without a single thought. 

There are vast deserts and oceans that are absolutely inhospitable to man. One day we'll return to an age where humanity and nature will work togeher, beautifully and harmoniously. But until then, we must slowly reverse our curse and continue to rule as best as possible, over the wild and unrelenting force that is nature.

For the time being, this will be a near never ending process. Each generation must face the Jungles of Jumanji and do its best to first conquer it, and then to rule over it benevolently. 

That's all I have for now. I think perhaps later I'll revisit the movie again but this time, with a video essay.
