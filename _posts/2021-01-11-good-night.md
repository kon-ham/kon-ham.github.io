<p class="has-text-align-center">
  In the twilight, a quiet moment &#8211;
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  my footsteps now the loudest creature of the night.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  The dark and vast velvet of the sky looks down at me
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  without critique, without judgement &#8211;
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  only silence and acceptance.
</p>
