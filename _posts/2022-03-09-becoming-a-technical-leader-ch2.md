title: Summary of "Becoming a Technical Leader", Ch. 2
---

This is a summary of Weinberg's "Becoming a Technical Leader". That means there is no idea here that is original to my own - I am summarizing the material for my learning and in case you might want a quick summary. All credit goes to Weinberg.

## The organic model of leadership
The organic model of leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people are empowered (Weinberg)

This being empowered means:
- Free to see
- Free to hear
- Free to feel
- Free to comment
- Free to move about
- Free to act
- Free to ask for what they want
- Free to be creative
- Free to make choices

The organic model also says people are unique. So each person will demonstrate different leadership styles.

## Weinberg's MOI
Weinberg introduces his model of leadership: MOI.
- M(otivation):
	- The trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved
- O(rganization):
	- The existing struture that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice
- I(deas or innovation):
	- The seeds, the image of what will become

Leadership can also prevent change which can also be modeled with a similar MOI:
- M(kill the motivation):
	- Make people feel that the change will not be appreciated, do everything for them so that they don't feel the need to do it themselves, discourage anything that people might enjoy doing for its own sake (Weinberg)
- O(foster chaos):
	- encourage high competition so that cooperation will not happen, keep resources slightly below minimum; suppress information of general value, bury it in an avalanche of meaningless words and paper
- I(suppress the flow of ideas):
	- Don't listen when you can criticize, give your own ideas first, punish those that offer suggestions, keep people from working together, no laughter

## The balance
In order for a leadership style to be effective there needs to be a balance among motivation, organization, and innovation. Some of us are better in certain elements than others. But all of us can grow in that process by building upon the strength of our weakest elements.

According to Weinberg, all of the most consistently successful technical leaders empower people by placing importance of the value of innovation, or doing things a better way.

Specifically they concentrate on three major areas:
  - Understanding the problem
  - Managing the flow of ideas
  - Maintaining quality

Improving becoming a technical leader does not mean you amputate your current behavior. (Weinberg) 

It means that you must simply add new behaviors that add to your repertoire. One at a time.

## The faith
Weinberg notices that problem solving leaders all have a key trait in common: a faith that there is always a better way.

Weinberg closes this chapter with the following quote:

> "My own faith says that there really is a better way, a way that can
> be learned and practiced by one person without harm to others. I also
> believe that all people can learn the problem-solving leadership style,
> even if they were discouraged as children or adults. That's the
> problem I'm working on, and that's why I've written this book."
