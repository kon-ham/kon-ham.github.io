Former FBI investigator gives comprehensive list of body language to indicate whether or not a person is comfortable or uncomfortable.

If you are looking for a way to detect if a person is lying, you're not going to find it here. 

The near final chapter of the book Joe Navarro himself says even the best authorities on subjects are no better than 50/50 chances of determining if a person is lying or not. So don't read this book in order to predict who's lying. 

Essentially, feet are the most honest part of the body and the body becomes less honest as you move up from the feet to the head. 

Your chance of determining if someone is lying is a coin toss.

But observing the body language is a good start.

This book is a better looked through the lens of business, communication, and salesmanship.
