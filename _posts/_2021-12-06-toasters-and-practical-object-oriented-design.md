title: Toasters and Practical Object Oriented Design

The Sunbeam Toaster and the parallel with Practical Objected Oriented Design:

We could strive to design code that works 50 years from now because it does one job well.

We could write code that has limited breaking points because it maintains a single responsibility.

We can write code that reflects a design choice to get the job done without future anticipation of consumer needs.

And we can design code in an elegant way that reflects a beauty hard to come across in an age of meaningless complexity.
