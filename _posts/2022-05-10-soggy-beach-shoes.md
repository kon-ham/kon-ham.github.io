I don't remember the beach
because it was deep in the night.
We were under the pier which we claimed
As our makeshift home for our honeymoon night
But I don't remember the beach.
Our coupled bodies now house warming gifts to ourselves - such sensory delight
How a tear fell from your face onto my cheek
Because when you asked me to take responsibility for our lives
I didn't respond and instead I turned my body
And you knew I was planning to leave
I don't remember the beach
But I remember my soggy shoes
