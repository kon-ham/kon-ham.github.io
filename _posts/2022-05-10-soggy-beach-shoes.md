I don't remember the beach
because it was deep in the night.
We were under the pier now our makeshift home
for our honeymoon night
But I don't remember the beach.
Our coupled bodies now house warming gifts - such sensory delight
How a tear fell from your face onto my cheek
Because you knew I was planning to leave
But I don't remember the beach
