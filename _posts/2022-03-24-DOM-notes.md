## The DOM
Reviewing JavaScript:
- Properties define the characteristics of an object
- Properties of an object can be access or set
- Methods allow actions to be performed on an object

The DOM (document object model) is an object based representation of a webpage. So on the basis of the above key points, we are able to manipulate the characteristics of the DOM object to get what we want.

The DOM is structured in a tree-like format. This means from the Document itself we can break down the element into further smaller structures that draw from its above structure or parent.

Every item in the structure is referred to as a node.

Each of these nodes are JavaScript objects.

You can have element nodes that draw from HTML tabs. You can have text nodes that draw from text.

When it comes to the mentioned structure of the DOM - the text nodes are the smallest children of the tree structure. There is no node that is smaller than the text node.

For browsers, the window object is the global object.

`document.body.addEventListener();` indicates that we are referencing the global object of `document`, targeting the `body` attribute, and then adding a method called `addEventListener()` that tells the object to wait for an event.

Let's add to this `addEventListener();`

```
document.body.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('You clicked the body of the page!');
});
```

We added two argument into the method of `addEventListener();`
- The first is the string value of `'click'`. This tells the `document` object to wait and listen for a click (or a tap). 
- The second argument is a function that logs a message via `console.log()` upon the event occurance.

Let's add to that.

```
const body = document.body;

body.addEventListener('click', () => {
    body.innerHTML = '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>';
});
```

Here we've modified our previous code so that now `document.body` is being referenced in a variable named `body`.

We can now reference `body` instead of `document.body`.

What we did inside of this function was to call `body`, which holds `document.body` and then select the attribute of `innerHTML` and then to assign the contents of the attribute of `innerHTML` to now be `'<h1>Hello, world!</h1>'`

Remember, the browser is the global environment for JavaScript. Within that, we have the `window` that is the global object for the entire webpage.

Within `window`, we have `window.document` which acts as the entry point for the web page's content.

## Select an Element by ID
HTML requires IDs to be unique, so we can actually call those IDs using JS and DOM to target specific elements of a page.

`document.getElementById('headline');` - you can replace `'headline'` with whatever ID you are trying to select.

Like we did above, we can use basic JavaScript functionality to assign `document.getElementById` so that we can call the variable instead of the `document` and its accompanying method each time we need to manipulate it.

Like so:
```
const headline = document.getElementById('headline')

headline.style.border = 'solix 2px red');
```

We can go even further with this assignment and add an `addEventListener();` to the selection of an element by ID.

```
const btnUpdate = document.getElementById('btn-main');
const headline = document.getElementById('headline');

btnUpdate.addEventListener('click', () => {
  headline.style.border = 'solid 2px red';
})
```

The above stores two variables - both of which are the result of storing a selected element by ID.

It says that, selecting our button, we then want to call `headline` variable to then do useful work. The button click acts as the event upon which `headline` changes.
