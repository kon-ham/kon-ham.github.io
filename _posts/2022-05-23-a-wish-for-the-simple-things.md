title: If I had one wish (A country song)
---

I know it ain't Christmas yet
but if I had one wish
It'd be for my mom and dad to have their teeth fixed
so that they can bite into a steak every now and then
I know it ain't Christmas yet

It's the simple things I'd wish for
Some ice cold beer and a nice cool breeze
And a little bit of shade with my best friends
It's the simple things I'd wish for

I know it ain't my birthday yet
but if I had one wish
It'd be for some peace and rest
so that my friends and family can finally sleep and feel their best
I know it aint my birthday yet

It's the simple things I'd wish for
To make peace with the people I fought
and to finally feel free under the moonlight stars
It's the simple things I'd wish for

I'd wish for the simple things, the things we take for granted
like air to breath and food to eat and drinks to drink

I'd wish for the simple things, I'd wish for the simple things
Make a wish
