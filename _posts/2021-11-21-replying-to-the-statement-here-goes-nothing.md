title: Replying to the statement "Here Goes Nothing"

A colleague on LinkedIn attempts to tell their story:

## And my reply

Hi Chris,

I believe you have a beautiful story to tell.

Because of this, I do not believe you should start your story with "Here Goes Nothing". The meaning of this phrase is explained in some dictionaries as something said before you begin to do something that you do not think will be successful.

Telling our own personal story is something that when told well will always result in a win.

I think it is important to be courageous at times when we do not believe that we may reap immediate benefit from an action. We sometimes call this "doing the right thing". Telling your story adequately, boldly, and with a little humility is always doing the right thing. We can be proud of our achievement in telling that story.

Your story is important. Your background is important. It is also something that is never said in vain nor is it something that you should be timid about.

In the history of the universe, there will never again be someone exactly like you. This little detail merits that you have a special purpose in the story of the universe in which you must be bold in telling your story.
