I try to go to the pool as often as I can so that I can get sunlight. I think a little bit of it is healthy for you. Just don't get sun burned.

Basking there, soaking it up I looked up and saw a bird - at first I thought it was a seagull but as it came closer I noticed its feathers were much darker in color, a sort of a dark tobacco brown. I don't know exactly the species. 

I saw it circle above it, hovering over the pool and without need to flap its wings to stay afloat. It must have encountered an invisible thermal or a pocket of hot air that was rising and keeping the bird hovering as long as it kept its wings stretched out. 

Seeing those wings stretched out, watching the micro adjustments needed to stay in the thermal, to ride it out, to stay level, I realized that I knew what it was like to be that bird and to fly. I could imagine the feeling of weightlessness as I was supported by a continuous gust of hot air. It was a balance of control and chaos as I gave up control of the direction and merely rode the thermal to my own delightful pleasure.

I think this is the power of the imagination. How close my imagination was to the visceral, sensory feel of what it is like to have the bone density of a bird with its feathers to help it to adjust high and low, left and right, I can't say.

But today, I knew what it was like to fly.
