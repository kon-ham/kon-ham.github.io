title: Let People Have Their Achievements
---

My mom is barely literate. But she navigates through Amazon's website with relative ease. This means she's able to order products, return products, gauge the quality of a product by looking through the reviews, and when needed, use a translator to hone down on Amazon's search feature for a variety of products.

It was not always like this. 

My Korean is conversation. But it is still a frustrating experience for me to speak Korean with my parents - of whom I must not only navigate the grammar and vocabulary, but also respect the honorific boundaries of the relationship that I have and my place in that relationship. There are about 7 levels of honorifics in the Korean language. This means that there are about seven different approaches to conversation with someone, depending on their status and the closeness of your relationship to that person.

Essentially it is a painful process for me to speak Korean. Either way I get by. But to add to that level of complexity is the need to speak technically while also breaking down technical concepts to an easy enough level so that my mom can understand what is happening on her computer.

Naturally the frustration builds up for both parties. 

Because of that level of frustration, sometimes my mom will attempt to troubleshoot her problems without asking me. Because of that, her technical achievement has grown and I've been freer from having to be a part-time help desk for my mom.

I did not intend for my mom to venture out on her own. I always expected to have to baby her. My own expectations for my mother was too low. And yet, she achieved greatness because little by little, she was willing to venture out into the unknown

But somehow she ended up going on her own and as a result, has achieved an impressive level of technical ability for someone that is functionally illiterate. 

CONCLUSION:

We may be too quick to try to swoop in to save a person. There may be levels of frustration involved when they do not get the help they look for. Sometimes they will need to be saved.

But it is important to learn to develop the discernment to determine when to step-in to help a person and when to allow a person to simmer in their troubles.

Then, when they achieve, we can proudly celebrate in their achievements. 

Perhaps it is a good thing to learn to develop patience in ourselves. It could be that developing that patience could lead to great achievements in others.

Here's to just holding on just a little bit longer!
