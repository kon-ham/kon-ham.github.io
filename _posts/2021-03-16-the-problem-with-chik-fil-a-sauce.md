title: The Problem With Chik-Fil-A Sauce

Here&#8217;s the thing. I love Chik-fil-a. They&#8217;re good. Customer service is good. Food quality is good. I&#8217;ve never had a bad experience with Chik-fil-a, minus the long lines I&#8217;d have to wait.

But here&#8217;s the _other_ thing. Chik-fil-a sauce is too good. In fact, it&#8217;s too good, it overpowers everything else. 

Try dipping a celery stick in Chik-fil-a sauce. All you taste is sauce. Try dipping the same celery stick in bufffalo-sauce. It&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s _complementary_. There&#8217;s a reason why ranch sauce is King (or Queen) when it comes to dipping veggies that nobody likes. Ranch, though yes, mostly overpowering, is _complementary._ It&#8217;s not overpowering. (Though, I&#8217;m sure some would argue that ranch sauce is also, overpowering.) But never mind the culinary opinions.

My question, within the framework of leadership is &#8211; are you overpowering others with the awesomeness of your sauce? Or are you complimenting the strengths of others with the complementary taste of your sauce?

Are you so eager to express the subtle hints of your flavors that you&#8217;re overpowering the meal as a whole? Or are you complementary, adding surprises to each bite, as a person explores the meal and not the flavors in and of themselves?

Some days call for Chik-fil-a sauce. Some days call for complimentary sauce. Like beef au jus sauce, for example.

There&#8217;s a difference!
