I never would have thought that one documentary about a woman would have clarified to me my role as a man. 

Diana, a women the world saw to be as a beautiful, charming, thoughtful and sometimes shy individual, was a person that grew up in a challenging environment. In her family life as a child she witnessed the trauma of fighting parents, her mother crying, and the sort of alienation a woman would feel typical in her class and role in the society of aristocratic English families.

We tend to think of these families as having lived a perfect and posh life, one in which worries and cares are washed away as a result of living without worry of money and status. Diana was a woman raised in the elite of the English class yet it would appear to be that problems and trauma exist in both the poor and the elite.

The biggest tragedy of Diana was that she was a young woman thrust into the public view to be held victim to the predatory claws of the English tabloids and media. She was hounded and hunted for so many reasons yet no reason big enough to justify the trauma inflicted upon her with so many inquiries into her public life.

My first take away from this documentary is that fame is a curse, not a blessing. It is not worth it to be famous and to be well known. It is better that not a single care is given to you by the media. In American society Americans may tend to look with envy towards the Hollywood associates of movies, producers, and influencers. I encourage you all to consider it a blessing that your name is not associated with merely the fact that you are a well known person. 

Secondly, the elite have the same problems in their lives. The only difference between us and them is that their lives unfold in the drama of a larger estate and bigger toys. The same desire for identity, independence, and purpose exist in both the poor and the rich.

Thirdly, a massive failure of society, and in this case, Diana's husband, was the failure to protect Diana. Diana, suffering from physical ailment and mental distress was left alone to fester despite her personal life completely plastered over the headlines. Nobody protected Diana, nobody (except a very select few group of friends) sought to understand her and to encourage her to become her own person.

Fourthly, men can be just as childish and heartless as any other person in this world. When a man takes a woman for his wife, it is his duty to protect her, to love her, to be vocal in encouragement and quiet in criticism, so that she can flower and bloom into a person that helps her husband to take on the attacks of the world. Her husband, supported by the system of the English monarchy, was utterly incapable of understanding Diana's woes. He was a man completely lost in his own head and selfish desires.

My personal takeaway from this documentary is this: I have acted as a complete failure as a man. It is so easy to look at her husband and to condescendingly criticize the man as being selfish, cold, narcissistic, and so on. Yet, Prince Charles is not just a man. He is a man that exists in the potential of all men. We should look at the inaction of Prince Charles and learn from him that we as men might not follow his mistakes. Women are such beautiful creatures and like all people, can be easily hurt and broken. 

I thought to myself is that as I think back at the many times I was cold, heartless, and judgemental to the women I've known in my past, I too was a Prince Charles in action. 

Conclusion:

Fame is a curse. I do not recommend you seek it. Do not be jealous of the elite. They have their own problems. Watch the movie to learn the necessity of man's role in a woman's life.

Here's to hoping you men grow into men that love their wives, support her, and help her to develop into becoming a woman that stands with you against the onslaught of the world. And together, you both can become victorious.
