title: Fighting Anxiety and Taking Initiative

When I start getting fidgety and anxious, I have to remind myself to go do something productive. Sometimes it's cleaning, and sometimes it's reengaging with my hobbies.

But for me, nothing beats a good old fashion, ass whoopin' workout. 

Jiu jitsu used to do this for me, and now that I'm going back to Jiu-Jitsu, it'll likely hit that spot for me again.

I'm talking about being worried about my future, wondering if I'm putting in enough effort to continue to progress my career and my skills (of course, I could probably be doing more, but within the context of expecting a return on my investment on a 10 year time line, I'm probably fretting for nothing), if I am this, or that, or how I come off, or how I sometimes talk to myself.

It goes on and on.

But then I go to Jiu-Jitsu and someone chokes the ever living hell out of me, and I'm reminded of a certain gravity, a certain sense of groundedness as I drive my tired butt home. Those drives for me are always empty-headed for me in the most marvelous and sensual experiences I have personally experienced. The sensual sense of being in the moment now, feeling the breeze on my face and in my hair, knowing how every inch of my body is covered in disgusting sweat - I am reminded - 'hey, a plan is one thing, but you're only ever able to live in the present.'

Today I did not go to Jiu-Jitsu but I went to the gym and I kicked my own ass. Then I went to the pool even though there was significant overcast and thunder from abroad.

Here I am, writing this, and feeling tired. Arms feel like rubber and I feel like my spine is barely able to support my body.

We can only live in the now. The past is also a dangerous place to live since as time progresses our memory gets hazier. We tend to have memories of events that take on its own life in our heads, and even the most grievous of sins we commit are readily forgotten.

The past must be looked as an opportunity to know that we came from a place of bondage, and, with gainful living in the moment, we can then look to the future for a day when we can have freedom from hurt, pain, sufferings, and injustice.

So in the mean time, for the moment, let's try to go do something that's productive. At the very minimum, some physical activity couldn't hurt.
