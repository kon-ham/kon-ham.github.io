People aren&#8217;t meant for broken relationships. None of us are. We are made to be loved and to love others.

Human life is really so precious, so resilient but also I come to feel that human life is fragile.Wounds can heal but scars remain.

At least for now. One day, maybe we&#8217;ll live in a world where even scars can be wiped away clean.

All it takes is really, just a few nasty words and now your perception is colored a certain way permanently. 

We&#8217;re not supposed to be using conversation to hurt people, but rather to build them up. And sometimes, we use the lack of conversation to also help encourage others.

I think about times I&#8217;ve said nasty things to others, and I think also about the other forgotten times I&#8217;ve said nasty things to others. 

We don&#8217;t have to do that! 

We can use our words carefully, possibly if we remember how fragile life can be.

On the flipside, sometimes we must use our words to be courageous. Don&#8217;t be afraid of saying something that needs to be said.

Takes some wisdom to know when to learn between the two.
