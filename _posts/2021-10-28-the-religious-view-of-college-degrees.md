title: The Religious View of College Degrees
---
People are afraid to make mistakes and it's easier to assume that a college graduate is a safer choice.

It's really a mindset that will take generations to change. People have been challenging the paradigm that college degrees imply greater value for decades now - still no change, only more debt.

Also, not always but gate keepers to employment tend to have degrees which exacerbates the issue.

The problem is that no amount of rational discussion will cause companies to change their mindset about the value of a college degree.

Inherently the view that college graduates hold greater value is a religious view rather than a rational and objective view. It's a waste of breath to argue religious views.

Anecdotally, I briefly attended a small liberal arts college where students were barely able to grasp reading comprehension.

We were reading Chaucer's Canterbury Tales but none of the students were able to understand the material was written as satire.

Like most students currently entering college, they were able to interpret words but they were not able to grasp the concepts behind the words.

This is typical for many people entering college, never mind that most students can barely count numbers.
