title: Leaders, Gardens, and Seeds
---


A model is a conceptual representation of a system of ideas.

To be an effective leader, you must be able to tolerate a large amount of models and to switch between those models as needed. (Weinberg)

One model is that which we might call an "organic model".

This view holds that a leader is a gardener in which the leader builds an environment for a seed to blossom into a beautiful flower. The gardener takes the innate power of the seed and and unleashes it through the creation of an environment in which the seed can thrive.

A leader is one that can be productive and creative through other people.
