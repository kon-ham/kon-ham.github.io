Title of Your Research Proposal: Understanding the Effects of Teaching Servant Leadership

Brief Description of Research Proposal (in 150 words or less): 

I am a looking to understand the effects of teaching a curriculum on servant leadership on the self-perceived feelings of empowerment of a learner population within the context of their own organization.

Please provide complete information for each of the following: 

  1. Describe the research method(s) and procedure(s) to be utilized in the proposed study. For action research studies, include an overview of the proposed intervention/instruction.  
    Research method will be a quantitative study to determine the relationship between two variables. They are the self-reported feelings of empowerment in relationship to the the learning curriculum teaching servant leadership. The procedure will take place as a curriculum taught over 8 hours to teach an introduction to servant leadership, the benefits of servant leadership, the problems currently facing modern organizations, and taking action to implement servant leadership. Before the curriculum is taught, a pre-test questionnaire will be administered in the form of a 5-point Likert Scale. It will demonstrate the amount of feelings of empowerment my learner group will have before the curriculum. After the curriculum is taught, a secondary post-test questionnaire will be administered. The format will be exactly the same as the pre-test. 
  2. Describe in detail the data collection tool(s) your study will employ (instruments such as tests, surveys, interview or focus group protocols, etc., as well as plans for audio or video recording data).  
    The data collection tool will be my own creation. It will utilize a 15 question 5 point Likert Scale to determine the levels of empowerment a person has currently and after the curriculum. The mean scores will be determined from both the pre-test and post-test scores to determine if after the curriculum a change in the mean scores can be affected through the curriculum teaching servant leadership.
  3. Describe the research population, including the age, number, and the relationship of any research participants to the researcher (“relationship” includes teacher/student, supervisor/employee, professional colleagues, etc.).  
    There will be 12 respondents, ranging from age 18 to 45. They will be fellow coworkers in my work environments. They are all military members. 
  4. Will your population include any members of vulnerable or protected populations such as (but not limited to) the following: individuals with physical or developmental disabilities, pregnant women, children, prisoners, residents of a facility such as a nursing home or group home, individuals with mental or emotional disabilities, non-English speakers, individuals at or above the age of 65, traumatized individuals, economically disadvantaged individuals, terminally ill individuals, or employees or students of the researcher? If so, explain the justification for including these populations and provide the contextual factors associated with this group of participants. (This refers to studies entirely composed of these individuals.We do not ask researchers to inquire about these categories in selecting participants. If known and part of a larger group, proper safeguards should be in place to ensure vulnerable individuals are not singled out or discriminated against. Please note that when research is conducted in a school setting, children and/or students of the researcher and/or individuals with disabilities are often included and must be discussed here as vulnerable subjects.) No.
  5. If your population includes children under the age of 18, identify whether your study poses (i) only minimal risk, (ii) greater than minimal risk but with a benefit to participants, or (iii) greater than minimal risk but with no benefit to participants, and explain your choice. No.
  6. Describe the steps that will be taken to minimize known risks (physical, emotional, psychological, etc.) to research participants. I will pass consent forms for all respondents as I explain to them the purpose of the research study and to inform them that the information they present in the pre-test and post-test will remain anonymous and that any information will be kept private.
  7. Describe the steps you will take to ensure anonymity and/or confidentiality of research participants and collected data and how you will deal with personal identifiers. If subjects will not participate in the study in an anonymous and/or confidential manner, discuss why this research design is necessary. The pre-test and post-test will not indicate a name. Any personal identifiers will be kept private, if any, and will require explicit written instruction before any information is released to other stakeholders.
  8. Discuss the procedures you will employ to gain informed consent from each stakeholder in your study, including administrator/supervisor of the organization, parent/guardian (if study includes minors), and participants (informed assent if participants are minors of middle school age or above). Please do not provide the content of the Informed Consent form; rather, describe the procedures you will follow to obtain consent. The procedures will be as follows. Before the research is conducted, a consent form will be passed to all potential respondents. They will be briefed on the purpose of the study and the extent to which any information will be released to others. I will explain to them that the information is conducted through an anonymous survey and that no information will be traceable back to the respondent. Only then will the research study commence once the respondent has consented to the study and briefed on its purpose. 

Reminder: If your research study requires access to members of organizations, agencies, school districts, etc., be sure to obtain the signature of a school or district administrator (for school-based research) or supervisor (for workplace- or organization-based research) on your Informed Consent form before submitting for IRB approval.
