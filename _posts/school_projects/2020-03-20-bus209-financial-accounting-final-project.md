How does Soda Pop Organics, Inc., encourage future growth?  
Soda Pop Organics, Inc., encourages future growth through the investment of small farms throughout developing countries. SPOI hopes to have over 150 international farms that grow organic sugar, fruit, and tea. In addition to this, SPOI has invested $2.5 million in a trademark branding approach to attract new investors and capital.  
A concern regarding the investment throughout developing countries: Countries that are developing are not yet politically stable and can undergo regime change quickly. Depending on the amount of investment in each country, the money could be considered a loss if political instability or regime change occurs.  
It is in these areas that infrastructure is still being developed so access to the farms and roads that can transport SPOI goods back and forth should be considered in each investment of the country and its likely or unlikely political instability.  
Further recommendations include growing a base of customers within each developing country so that the each farm and developing plants are growing alongside the rising incomes of the various nations that SPOI wishes to develop as a part of its mission.  
This means that drinks should include regional flavors that still maintain consistency with SPOI’s methods and outlook – i.e., organic.  
Highly leveraged approaches to revenue may be considered unattractive to investors who are looking for consistencies throughout SPOIs mission and financial statement. It seems unlikely that SPOI would need an aggressive approach to leverage since the investment and development of small farms of developing countries would require time.
