title: Turtle on Top of a Fence Post
---

“Anytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help.”

- Alex Haley, Roots

Just wanted to share a quote that embodies the gratitude I feel to everyone I have met in my life.

Every single person I've met has helped me to grow so much. Much of that growth was painful as it involved taking a critical look at myself - but the growth has been good for me in countless ways.

Please thank the people in your lives or at least summon a spirit of thankfulness in your heart for the people in your lives.

Even the negative forces, should you decide to cultivate those experiences to propel you forward, has helped you grow.

Thank the people in your lives.
