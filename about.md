## Hi! Kon here - My Background:
I am a software engineer, United States veteran (USCG), high-school dropout, former undocumented immigrant, and the son of a humble dry-cleaner. 

Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in education (B.A Early Childhood Education, M.Ed. Instructional Design).

I'm 1/4 done with my MBA but this is a project I may not return to finish.

My current tech stack is: **Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CI, Heroku and Liquid**

I'm currently learning: **Python/Django** and **JavaScript**

Iâ€™ve also recently obtained national and state accreditation as an emergency medical technician basic (**NREMT EMT-B**) and am looking for opportunities to volunteer my time in my local community. Let me know if you have any leads for volunteer work as an EMT!
