## My name is Kon Ham.
This website is my portfolio to demonstrate my writing and communication, software development skills, analysis on business, advertising, sales and marketing, and generally how I like to think about things.

On top of that, I also blog post here to share more of my intimate thoughts.

Sometimes I write poetry.

## My Background:
I am a software developer, United States veteran, and a high-school dropout. (Ask me how I feel about the public school system!)

Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in education: **B.A Early Childhood Education, M.Ed. Instructional Design**.

I'm one semester into obtaining my MBA but I am holding off completing it until I get a clearer idea of my current career trajectory. (I want to be sure I am counting my costs adequately)

My current tech stack is: **Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CI, Heroku and Liquid**

I'm currently learning: **Python/Django**

Iâ€™ve also recently obtained national and state accreditation as an emergency medical technician basic (**NREMT EMT-B**) and am looking for opportunities to volunteer my time in my local community.

Please let me know if you have any leads for volunteer work.
