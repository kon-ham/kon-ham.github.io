## My name is Kon Ham.
This is where I dump everything I find interesting. You'll also find loads of personal thoughts on business, marketing, life, movies, books and general self-improvement. 

## My Background:
I am a software developer, United States veteran, and a proud high-school dropout. (Ask me how I feel about the public school system!)

Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in education: **B.A Early Childhood Education, M.Ed. Instructional Design**. I'm one semester into obtaining my MBA but I may not finish.

The skills I'm currently utilizing are: **Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CI, Heroku and Liquid**

Iâ€™ve also recently obtained national and state accreditation as an emergency medical technician basic (**NREMT EMT-B**) and am looking for opportunities to volunteer my time in my local community. 

Please let me know if you have any leads.

Because my background and experience is varied, I have a wide range of experiences that might be useful to you.  

My hope is that at least one post on this site contributes to adding value to your life so that your time here is not wasted.
