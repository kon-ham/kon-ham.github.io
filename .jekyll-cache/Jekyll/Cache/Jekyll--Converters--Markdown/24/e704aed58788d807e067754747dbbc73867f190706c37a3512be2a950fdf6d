I"B<p>This is a case study of the infants and toddlers of Newberry Child Care Center. Newberry Child Care Center is located in Newberry, South Carolina. This center provides for infants and toddlers ages 6 weeks to 12 years old. Mrs. Harker is the primary caregiver. Ms. Johnson is the assistant. I will be identifying principles of development between the children as well as identifying potential “at risk behaviors” that could be related to developmental disabilities. I will also be identifying ways in which the caretakers can foster trust and autonomy in the infants and toddlers. Finally, I will be identifying potential opportunities in which the families, caretakers, centers, schools, and communities can affect the development of the infants and toddlers at the Newberry Child Care Center. The first principle of early development is Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development. Erikson believed that children develop in a series of stages. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) In each of these stages of development, Erikson proposed that the child has a conflict in which a trait, or “virtue” is either developed or underdeveloped. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) This view of personality growth was predicated on the proposal that each stage of development was built in a predetermined order building upon one another. (“Basic Theories and Principles of Child Development”, 2018) Because this essay focuses on the development of children, specifically infants and toddlers, I will only be covering the first four stages of Erikson’s psychosocial development. These four stages of development according to Erikson are: the trust vs. mistrust stage, the autonomy vs. shame and doubt stage, the initiative vs. guilt stage, and the industry vs. inferiority stage.</p>
