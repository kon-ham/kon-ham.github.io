I"û<p>Organizational Framework ‚Äì Vision Statement<br />
Imagination Day Care Center is a Christian day care ministry that provides high quality child care that results in children reading before they enter into kindergarten. This ministry seeks to serve the local communities and families by providing this high-quality child care service by molding children into disciplined, consistent, and literate adults that seek to change the world around them to make the world a better place ‚Äì this change to make the world a better place first starts with the families of the local communities and families that Imagination Day Care Center seeks to serve. Imagination Day Care Center seeks to pursue these goals because the staff members of Imagination Day Care Center believe in the good works aspect of a Christian. That is that, ‚ÄúFaith Without Good Works is Dead‚Äù. With this belief that faith must be applied into productive practice, Imagination Day Care Center equips staff members all tools necessary to mold children into Christians that will one day change the world for a more prosperous and peaceful time.<br />
Organizational Framework ‚Äì Mission Statement<br />
Imagination Day Care Center exists to provide high-quality child-care service in order to entice families of the surrounding community to learn about Jesus Christ. Imagination Day Care Center acts as an outreach ministry in order to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the molding of children in order that they can be like ‚Äúsalt and light‚Äù to their families and beyond. Imagination Day Care Center first serves God through faithful ministry and practice of faith by action, which is to teach children to read and write before entering kindergarten. Second, Imagination Day Care Center serves the mothers and fathers of those children with the belief that God has given responsibility and authority to these parents to raise the children into productive and passionate members of society. Finally, Imagination Day Care Center serves the children who will one day grow older and ready to take on responsibilities to make the world a better place through the firm conviction of Christian morality and values. These morals and values come through Judeo-Christian values. That is one, that people will one day be held accountable to God for their actions. Second, that hypocrisy is not acceptable of a Christian, or that ‚Äúyou must remove the plank before your own eye before attempting to remove the speck from your brother‚Äôs eye.‚Äù And third, that Christians must love God first, and to love their neighbors second. With these convictions Imagination Day Care Center seeks to raise children that are considerate of their own actions and are concerned with the well-being of others because of the fact that one day they too will be held accountable for their works and their actions.<br />
