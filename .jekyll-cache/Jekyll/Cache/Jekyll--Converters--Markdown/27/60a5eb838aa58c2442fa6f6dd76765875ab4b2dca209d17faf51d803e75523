<p>I should preface this post with a very important point: I have not been in a committed relationship for nearly a decade, so as this post is an advice post, I suggest you take into consideration my background before you think about taking my advice.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>I think the biggest mistake that men can make is to try to choose a woman.</p>

<p>While I think men should be on the lookout for a woman with desirable traits (whatever those traits are) and I think it‚Äôs important for men to know what they want, I don‚Äôt think that a man should do the choosing.</p>

<p>In fact, I think that for the majority of men, they were never in a position of being able to choose. They just happened to be at the right place and at the right time, <em>and the woman chose</em>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not just that women choose and men are chosen, and it‚Äôs not just about being in the right place and the right time.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also about the idea that <em>not everyone will like you</em>, and that‚Äôs OK.</p>

<p>Attraction, like power, is not static, but it is dynamic and in a constant state of flux. Concerning your level of attraction to someone, sometimes you‚Äôll be right on point. Sometimes you‚Äôll miss the mark and it really will be out of your locus of control.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs my advice: be open to chaos and the unpredictability of the attraction spectrum. You win some, you lose some. Try to manage and minimize your losses.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve been pining for the attention of a woman and she has not reciprocated, you need to move on. Now. Yesterday. Delete her from your mind from ever being a possibility. It‚Äôs also probably not a good idea to remain her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù anymore, mostly because you‚Äôve probably already ruined that avenue already. Be cordial. Be respectful. Laugh and enjoy your time with her. But move on. She has not chosen you.</p>

<p>Continue to make progress as your own person and know that you can at a certain point, be at the right place and right time to be chosen. Increase your likelihood of this happening by getting out by doing something spontaneous, while at the same time strengthening the routines in your life that bring you positive gain.</p>

<p>The best thing about being chosen is that it is ultimately the path of least resistance. She chose you because she thinks you‚Äôre the bees knees. You‚Äôre rad, she thinks. She likes you because you‚Äôre you, and this means you don‚Äôt have to fake being some guy. You can just continue to be you and continue to improve who you are as a person.</p>

<p>This perspective also takes a lot of pressure off of you about trying to impress a woman. Blabber on about your fascination about mycology and why the <em>kingdom animalia</em> needs a fifth kingdom to account for fungi.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
