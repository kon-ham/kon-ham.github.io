  The world is full of pain and suffering
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Everyday humanity aches and throbs
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Our suffering points direction to our future home
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  As we cope and bear our crippled walk
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Hope gives us respite, a cool shade from the blistering sun
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  So for today I&#8217;ll smile a little more and laugh a little louder
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Today I&#8217;ll set in stone a future better than is today
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Build for the future generations &#8211; laughs and smiles from the past
