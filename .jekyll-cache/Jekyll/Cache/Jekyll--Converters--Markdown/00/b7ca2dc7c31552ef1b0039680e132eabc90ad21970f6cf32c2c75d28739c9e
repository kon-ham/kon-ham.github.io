I"Y<p>Former FBI investigator gives comprehensive list of body language to indicate whether or not a person is comfortable or uncomfortable.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a way to detect if a person is lying, you’re not going to find it here.</p>

<p>The near final chapter of the book Joe Navarro himself says even the best authorities on subjects are no better than 50/50 chances of determining if a person is lying or not. So don’t read this book in order to predict who’s lying.</p>

<p>Essentially, feet are the most honest part of the body and the body becomes less honest as you move up from the feet to the head.</p>

<p>Your chance of determining if someone is lying is a coin toss.</p>

<p>But observing the body language is a good start.</p>

<p>This book is a better looked through the lens of business, communication, and salesmanship.</p>
