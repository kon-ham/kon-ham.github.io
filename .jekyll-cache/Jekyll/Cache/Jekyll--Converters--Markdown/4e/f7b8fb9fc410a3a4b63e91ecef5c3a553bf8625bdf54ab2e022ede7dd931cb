<p>This is where I dump everything I find interesting. Youâ€™ll also find loads of personal thoughts on business, marketing, life, movies, books and general self-improvement.</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My Background:</h2>
<p>I am a software developer, United States veteran, and a proud high-school dropout. (Ask me how I feel about the public school system!)</p>

<p>Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in education: <strong>B.A Early Childhood Education, M.Ed. Instructional Design</strong>. Iâ€™m one semester into obtaining my MBA but I may not finish.</p>

<p>The skills Iâ€™m currently utilizing are: <strong>Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CI, Heroku and Liquid</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also recently obtained national and state accreditation as an emergency medical technician basic (<strong>NREMT EMT-B</strong>) and am looking for opportunities to volunteer my time in my local community.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any leads.</p>

<p>Because my background and experience is varied, I have a wide range of experiences that might be useful to you.</p>

<p>My hope is that at least one post on this site contributes to adding value to your life so that your time here is not wasted.</p>
