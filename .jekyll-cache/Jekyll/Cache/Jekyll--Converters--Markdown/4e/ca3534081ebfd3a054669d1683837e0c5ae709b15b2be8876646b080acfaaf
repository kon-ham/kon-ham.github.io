I"š<p>Netflix is a company founded by Reed Hastings in 1999. The company originally<br />
started with a mail-by-order DVD rental service. (â€œHow Netflix got startedâ€, 2009)<br />
Although Netflix still provides this service, it is possibly most well known for delivering<br />
entertainment content through the internet. This service is called â€œstreamingâ€ and<br />
involves consumers being able to instantly view content with the ability to pause, rewind,<br />
and fast forward video or audio. This streaming service is made possible with internet<br />
access and differs from conventional television in that the user decides what program to<br />
view.</p>
