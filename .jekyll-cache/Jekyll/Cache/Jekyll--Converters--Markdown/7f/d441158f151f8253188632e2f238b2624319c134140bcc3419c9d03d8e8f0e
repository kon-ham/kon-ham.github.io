I"≈<p>I find myself wondering what life would be like if our current society was more of a traditionalist society. For all of the criticisms of the Middle Ages, nobody will argue that the inhabitants of that time period ever wondered existentialist questions such as ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is the purpose and meaning of life?‚Äù.</p>

<p>It could be said, that because the Middle Ages was marked by brutality and short life expectancy that such inhabitants were never offered such an opportunity to consider such questions.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think so.</p>

<p>Life was short during those periods, but the vast majority of people in the Middle Ages worked far less than we do as modern society. They had plenty of time (relatively speaking), to consider existential questions.</p>

<p>However, they probably didn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>The questions of existentialism is unique to our age, and possibly, unique to other societies that are facing identity crises.</p>

<p>I think traditionalist societies have much we could learn from. Most importantly, how do we create happy and fulfilled people?</p>

<p>I think the biggest obstacle to happiness and fulfillment is in the paradox of freedom of identity. How do we know who we are in an endless sea of options?</p>

<p>Watching Harry Potter, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the reason why Harry Potter was so successful as a series is that the magical world is filled with <em>tradition</em>. Hogwarts is a school anyone would want to attend. In this magical world, people are <em>content</em>. People have a place and identity. In our world, we have no identity but the freedom to choose our identity.</p>

<p>I think my biggest question for those waning for a more traditionalist society is this: how do traditionalist societies deal with the concept of evil? How do we punish those violate the rules or boundaries?</p>

<p>When I think of a traditionalist society, I think of happiness, but I don‚Äôt know what such a society would do in correct injustice and punishing evil-doers.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs all I have today.</p>

<p>I encourage you to dream with me about a world where people have solid identities, fulfilled lives, and deep and satisfying purpose that drives people through life and death.</p>
