I"O<p>I find myself wondering what life would be like if our current society was more of a traditionalist society. For all of the criticisms of the Middle Ages, nobody will argue that the inhabitants of that time period ever wondered existentialist questions such as “who am I?” or “what is the purpose and meaning of life?”.</p>
