I"ç<p>Stephen R. Covey explains a development in his marriage life: For years he had expressed a frustration with Sandra, his wife, and her obsession with Frigidaire appliances. She was completely illogical with her obsession, preferring it to all other brands, even in the face of objective data that the price of other appliances was lower or that the quality of the other brands being better.</p>

<p>Fast forward years later Stephen and Sandra happen to develop a shared experience together where they slowly ride around a wooded area in a 4√ó4. There they shared many experiences and feelings. They were in tune with each other as they began to accept each other for who they were. Sometimes, the pain of past trauma and experiences would become too great and they would stop sharing for the day.</p>

<p>One day they eventually come across the topic of the Frigidaire. Ends up, Sandra‚Äôs father was an appliance wholesaler. After work, Sandra‚Äôs father would come home and Sandra would massage her father‚Äôs feet while her father opened up to her about the privates of the business, his insecurities and worries. Sandra grew up to cherish these times because of that openness. During an especially rough period in his business, Frigidaire was the only brand that would finance the appliances to her father, and many times, while having his feet massaged, Sandra‚Äôs father would express gratitude and thankfulness to Frigidaire for essentially saving the business.</p>

<p>Stephen realizes many things upon this revelation. Of course Sandra is being illogical ‚Äì Sandra isn‚Äôt purchasing Frigidaire on the basis of objective price, quality, and value. She was purchasing loyalty. She was purchasing a bit of her father‚Äôs gratitude to Frigidaire.</p>

<p>The realization between the two was that the issue of the Frigidaire appliance had become an issue of contention in many other ways. In a sort of a ripple effect, one issue had begun to touch into many other issues of their marriage.</p>

<p>One thing to understand is that the true reason for the Frigidaire obsession would never have surfaced if both Sandra and Stephen hadn‚Äôt begun to somehow slip into a state in which both parties were fully willing to sit and understand, putting away their own selfish desire to be understood first.</p>

<p>So many of us are walking around blind in our relationships. We see what we want to see and assume we are correct. In the language of 7 Habits, we operate in a Win/Lose paradigm.</p>

<p>Let me encourage you all: How many relationships are you currently allowing to starve because you are not willing to seek to understand before seeking to be understood? An entire orchid of blossoms awaits those of you that are willing to put in hard work into relationships that bloom and blossom as a result of investment of time and ear.</p>

<p>People act illogically. Duh! Try to understand why ‚Äì you might be surprised and what you get from it.</p>
