I"'<p>I am in need of a vehicle.</p>

<p>Well, at this point, it’s more or less “would be nice to have” rather than an immediate need.</p>

<p>So I’m looking around for trucks, exploring financing and payment options and I’m sharing this with my Mom.</p>

<p>One thing leads to another and we get on the conversation of life.</p>

<p>I admit to her that this past year has been incredibly difficult for me, mentally, spiritually, and physically.</p>

<p>I know she knows that I have been struggling with my life, though overall I have been relatively productive – the seeds of my work are planted, now I must water and wait.</p>

<p>My Mom tells me that she too has had a difficult year.</p>

<p>In fact, she tells me the past few years, in fact, decades, had been incredibly hard for her.</p>

<p>She tells me she has considered suicide at points in her life.</p>

<p>She tells me the only thing that has kept her going was her determination to see her children live a better life than what she has and will have had.</p>

<p>Naturally this broke my heart. I wiped tears from my eyes and I gave her a kiss, and I thanked her for living for my sake.</p>

<p>This is the beauty of not only just my mom, but my father. Not only just my mother and father, but to the mothers and fathers everywhere that worked for the betterment of their children.</p>

<p>I do not believe life is only for the sake of our own pleasure.</p>

<p>My mother and father lived incredibly difficult lives in the United States as immigrants. I am always humbled to see that they’ve continued to stick it out. I know of many other immigrants that return to their home country because of the immense difficulties in the immigrant life.</p>

<p>My father tells me of a time when his friend returned back to Korea after being shot in the stomach – this friend had been operating a convenience store in St. Louis and was a victim of an attempted robbery and attempted murder.</p>

<p>Another story of a friend of ours that committed suicide after his wife had left him – nobody knew until the apartment began to smell and neighbors called the property management.</p>

<p>I do not think my parents have necessarily a happy marital life. I believe that were it not the immense struggles they had experienced, my parents would have divorced some time ago. I also believe that were it not for my mother, her beautiful traits of steadfastness and ability to endure, my father would have collapsed physically, spiritually, and mentally.</p>

<p>I’m aware that for some or many Americans, the objective of a marriage is for happiness and love. I think this is a wonderful thing to aspire to. To add to this, I think that the marriage should act as a protective shield around the brutal realities of reality.</p>

<p>My mother is a beautiful woman. Yet I know that I’ve abused her beauty by being careless with her. I’ve spoken roughly to her, I’ve taken advantage of her kindness.</p>

<p>Yet, she endures and continues to love me and continues to always, the next day, start over with me.</p>

<p>What a beautiful woman.</p>
