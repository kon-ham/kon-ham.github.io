    <strong>Those with the growth mindset, on the other hand, can acknowledge their partners’ imperfections,</strong> without assigning blame, and still feel that they have a fulfilling relationship. <strong>They see conflicts as problems of communication, not of personality or character.</strong> This dynamic holds true as much in romantic partnerships as in friendship and even in people’s relationships with their parents.

    When people embark on a relationship, they encounter a partner who is different from them, and they haven’t learned how to deal with the differences. In a good relationship, people develop these skills and, as they do, both partners grow and the relationship deepens. <strong>But for this to happen, people need to feel they’re on the same side.</strong> . . . As an atmosphere of trust developed, they [become] vitally interested in each other’s development.

    What it all comes down to is that a mindset is an interpretative process that tells us what is going on around us. In the fixed mindset, that process is scored by an internal monologue of constant judging and evaluation, using every piece of information as evidence either for or against such assessments as whether you’re a good person, whether your partner is selfish, or whether you are better than the person next to you. In a growth mindset, on the other hand, the internal monologue is not one of judgment but one of voracious appetite for learning, constantly seeking out the kind of input that you can metabolize into learning and constructive action.

<p>We need to encourage children when they put effort into things instead of simply telling children that they are smart. We can also apply this concept to our loved ones and peers – stop telling people they are smart – we are simply admonishing one’s fragile ego. Instead we need to be praising others for doing the right thing, especially when it is difficult to do so. We need to praise others for trying difficult things and failing, because failure is where we learn the most. I do not advocate others simply go into debt and bankruptcy in the search of a failure, but failure need not be feared – it must instead be embraced as a natural cause of the progress of one’s self.</p>

<p>Today, I encourage you to do something that you have been afraid of. Go do something difficult, even if you will fail at it.</p>

<p>What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
