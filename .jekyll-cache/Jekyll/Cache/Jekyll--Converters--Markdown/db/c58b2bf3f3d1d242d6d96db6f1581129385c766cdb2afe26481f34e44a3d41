I"<p>People are afraid to make mistakes and it’s easier to assume that a college graduate is a safer choice.</p>

<p>It’s really a mindset that will take generations to change. People have been challenging the paradigm that college degrees imply greater value for decades now - still no change, only more debt.</p>

<p>Also, not always but gate keepers to employment tend to have degrees which exacerbates the issue.</p>

<p>The problem is that no amount of rational discussion will cause companies to change their mindset about the value of a college degree.</p>

<p>Inherently the view that college graduates hold greater value is a religious view rather than a rational and objective view. It’s a waste of breath to argue religious views.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I briefly attended a small liberal arts college where students were barely able to grasp reading comprehension.</p>

<p>We were reading Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales but none of the students were able to understand the material was written as satire.</p>

<p>Like most students currently entering college, they were able to interpret words but they were not able to grasp the concepts behind the words.</p>

<p>This is typical for many people entering college, never mind that most students can barely count numbers.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage that holding a college degree has is the implied value that you are were reliably boring enough to sit through four years of college classes.</p>

<p>This in turn means you’ll probably show up to work, attend all the meetings, and you can be expected to turn in your work when given a deadline.</p>

<p>You can train animals to do this with Pavlovian conditioning and some of those animals will even forgo a salary in exchange for peanuts.</p>
