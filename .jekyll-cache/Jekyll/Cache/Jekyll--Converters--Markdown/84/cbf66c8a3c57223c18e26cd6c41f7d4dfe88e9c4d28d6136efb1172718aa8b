    <strong>Those with the growth mindset, on the other hand, can acknowledge their partners’ imperfections,</strong> without assigning blame, and still feel that they have a fulfilling relationship. <strong>They see conflicts as problems of communication, not of personality or character.</strong> This dynamic holds true as much in romantic partnerships as in friendship and even in people’s relationships with their parents.
