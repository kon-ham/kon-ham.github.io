I"¯<p>In the near future, the companies that will innovate and trail blaze will be the companies that can take our current ideals, morals, and values and improve upon them.</p>

<p>In such a world, we donâ€™t look at the past with a sense of nostalgia but rather a sense of understanding and humility.</p>

<p>Nostalgia is for a culture that has lost its way, no longer innovating but rather looking at the past for answers.</p>

<p>Our hope lies in the future and the answers are for those that can look forward into the future.</p>

<p>It is easy to take a look at the current landscape and grow pessimistic or cynical. In fact, this is the natural way. But we must be strong and courageous and be willing to put in the hard work to propel ourselves into the future.</p>

<p>The world is rife with problems â€“ these problems can be solved and the future can be a place we can look forward to.</p>

<p>In the mean time, until such companies exist, it is up to us as individuals to decide that every day is an opportunity to grow and improve and to engage in healthy discourse.</p>

<p>I look forward to being in such a world with you all.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s to a beautiful future looking forwards.</p>
