I"k<p>People aren’t meant for broken relationships. None of us are. We are made to be loved and to love others.</p>

<p>Human life is really so precious, so resilient but also I come to feel that human life is fragile.Wounds can heal but scars remain.</p>

<p>At least for now. One day, maybe we’ll live in a world where even scars can be wiped away clean.</p>

<p>All it takes is really, just a few nasty words and now your perception is colored a certain way permanently.</p>

<p>We’re not supposed to be using conversation to hurt people, but rather to build them up. And sometimes, we use the lack of conversation to also help encourage others.</p>

<p>I think about times I’ve said nasty things to others, and I think also about the other forgotten times I’ve said nasty things to others.</p>

<p>We don’t have to do that!</p>

<p>We can use our words carefully, possibly if we remember how fragile life can be.</p>

<p>On the flipside, sometimes we must use our words to be courageous. Don’t be afraid of saying something that needs to be said.</p>

<p>Takes some wisdom to know when to learn between the two.</p>
