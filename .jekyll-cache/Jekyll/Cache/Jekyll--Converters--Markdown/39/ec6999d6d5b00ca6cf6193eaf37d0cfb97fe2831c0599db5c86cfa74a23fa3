I"[<p>Dear Mr. Jenkins,</p>

<p>In advertising there is a saying – ‘lead with the benefits’.</p>

<p>A customer does not care what you tell your employees or what you tell others. In fact, they don’t care about you at all until it comes down to what you can do for your customers.</p>

<p>Instead of leading with “Mr. Jenkins told me…”, I think the better approach is “Mr. Jenkins guarantees…”, though I think still this is not the ideal headlines – I would in fact remove your name from the headline completely. </p>

<p>I applaud your advertising drive, but the advertisements could afford to be tweaked and you are likely throwing away money by failing to lead with the benefits. </p>

<p>How sure are you that the “Mr. Jenkins told me…” headline actually converts potential buyers to real customers?</p>

<p>While I think it makes for entertainment having your employees dance and sing in a 30 second ad, there is no headline to grasp your audience’s attention and there is no definitive call to action. I am an HVAC ignoramus – how do I know that your services being “gently” applied to my air conditioning units have any sort of real benefit to me, except that it should be obvious that you treat my personal belongings with care? I can’t even understand what your employees are singing – there is too much going on.</p>

<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

<p>Very respectfully,</p>

<p>Kon Ham</p>

<p>Video in question: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDSamktplo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDSamktplo</a></p>

<p>A few takeaways:</p>

<p>Jingles and chimes (sort of) work for large companies that have a solid foothold in a customer’s mind. Examples of this include Coca Cola and McDonald’s.</p>

<p>This sort of advertisement does not work for a regional brand.</p>

<p>Every day a person that once knew about your services dies and every day a new person that knows nothing about your services is born into this world. This is why you must always generate new leads.</p>

<p>Sales is the driving life-blood of any company.</p>

<p>You must always, always lead with the benefits. What separates your company’s services from the multitude of other businesses that exist and are competing for the attention of your potential customer?</p>

<p>Once you have led with the benefits, you must then provide a call to action. The above advertisement does not include a call to action. A call to action can be as simple as “CALL NOW for a free consultation.”</p>

<p>My suggestion to Mr. Morris Jenkins is this:</p>

<p>Produce a 10 part mini series on Youtube that gives tips and tricks to save money on heating and air conditioning bills. This 10 part series will provide useful information to your customer on how they can save money by absorbing information you are providing to them (for free).</p>

<p>This will accomplish a few things. First, you establish in the mind of your customer that you are an authority on the subject. Secondly, you establish trust and rapport because you are providing a free informational service that helps them to save money. Any person that helps save me money is a new friend to me.</p>

<p>Finally, the 10 part series can help channel potential new customers into your sales team. At the end of this series you provide a call to action that encourages your potential customer to call your sales associates for a free consultation.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins, you are throwing away money by advertising on YouTube among other advertising channels without introducing a clear and concise headline that separates you from your other competitors. You only have a few seconds to grab the attention of your potential customer. Do not waste that opportunity by failing to grab their attention.</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

<p>A person that calls your sales associate after watching a 10 part mini-series on saving HVAC costs is already pre-qualified to be sold to. This means that you have a motivated and serious buyer, as they’ve already spend their time watching a 10-part series on saving monthly HVAC bills.</p>

<p>This makes for selling your services a whole lot easier on your sales associates. They will have an easier time selling your services.</p>

<p>Finally, creating a 10 part series on YouTube is an example of a high return on investment. If you were to include information that is timeless, relevant, and practical, you will always have free advertising on YouTube that has a nearly endless audience. This will enable you to further establish yourself as an authority on this subject and will only help you to grow your business to your desires.</p>

<p>I hope you the best, Mr. Jenkins.</p>
