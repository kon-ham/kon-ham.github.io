<p>Discussion of Instructional Problem<br />
Enlisted members at my base are unable to articulate basic electrical safety standards. The target group is the number of attached service members at my base. Though not all of the attached service members at my base deal with potential electrical hazards, all members could benefit from a basic understanding of electricity. Such an understanding of electricity should increase the likelihood of compliance of basic electrical safety procedures that can benefit service members in public and personal places that conduct electricity.<br />
Contributing Factors to the Instructional Problem<br />
Electricity is a common resource in our society. Until the power goes out, the majority of people that are dependent upon electricity for day to day activities tend to take such power for granted. When asked, most people will be unable to articulate why and how electricity is generated. Furthermore, because most people are not on a basic level of understanding of electricity, they do not know why basic electrical safety procedures should be followed, other than that the lack of following electrical safety can cause injury or death.<br />
Comparison of Conditions<br />
There is no indication that service members are either interested or knowledgeable about basic electrical theory and safety. In order to make the comparison, two states of conditions are defined through the use of a qualitative survey and a true or false pretest. These tests will indicate first what the current condition is for the service members on my base, and if the results meet the minimum threshold, the assessment would indicate that an instruction can be a means to meet the desired conditions held by myself, which is that service members are able to articulate a basic level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety.<br />
Current Conditions. Current condition is that there is no indication to the level of which each service members has of electrical knowledge and safety. Therefore, a test is administered to provide a quantitative and qualitative threshold in order to discover whether or not service members meet the criteria for instruction. This current condition would indicate that service members do not meet the basic threshold of scoring at least a 70% threshold measured from the combined score of the two data collection instruments.<br />
Desired Condition. The desired condition would be that service members on my base are able retake both the data collection instruments used and there would be an overall improvement in the qualitative survey and the true and false quiz at a minimum passing requirement of 70%.<br />
Data Collection Process<br />
Discussion of Data Collection Instruments Used<br />
Qualitative data was used for the first data collection instrument. Specifically, an individual interview was used so that respondents could reflect and write what they thought they knew about electricity and electricity safety. This interview was guided by a set of 5 standardized questions that were asked to the respondents. Before the interview, respondents are given the option to answer “I do not know” or “I have no interest in the topic” to any of the questions asked. The second instrument is a 10 question “true” or “false” quiz that the same people are asked to answer. This survey allows for a quantitative measurement of knowledge based on a 50/50 chance.<br />
Discussion of Sources of Data<br />
There are 52 members assigned to my base. Of the 52 members, 10 members are selected randomly, with at least 2 members from each department of the base. There are three departments on our base. The first is the operational side, which involves logistics and supply. The second is administrative, which involves administrative work as well as pay, and finally engineering, which involves facilities and naval engineers to resolve technical issues.<br />
Secondly, a pretest is used to analyze the amount of questions a service member can answer correctly on a standardized test. This will give me a quantitative source of comparison between the percentage answered correctly before the instruction and the percentage answered correctly after the instruction.<br />
Data Gathered Through Other Sources<br />
No other source was used.<br />
Process of Data Analysis<br />
Data Analysis Techniques Used<br />
There is no right or right answer for the qualitative survey. But since I want to quantify the data, I measured each “I don’t know” or “I don’t care” response as if it was an incorrect answer. For example, two responses of “I don’t know” or “I don’t care” would be quantified as 3 out of 5 questions “correct”, which would be scored as a 60%.<br />
Secondly, the second data collection instrument is a true or false exam. I will keep a record of how many questions were missed, what questions were missed, and what questions were answered with “I don’t know” and “I don’t care”, all of which could indicate that the questions were leading or inappropriately worded. Having a base level of knowledge of which questions were missed the most or answered as incomplete will help me to further refine the questions for the next set of data collection if needed as well as indicating to me a source of instruction that may be needed if the majority of respondents answered the question incorrectly or left the question blank. (The majority being greater than or equal to 50% of respondents answering the question incorrectly or left blank)<br />
The quantified data is calculated as such: I combined the total number of questions from both the qualitative and quantitative survey for a total of 15 possible questions to be answered. Of the 15, a minimum of 11 questions answered correctly will score a 73%, which mathematically is the lowest possible amount of questions answered correctly to pass the 70% threshold I have established. If the total number of respondents average a percentage score greater than or equal to 70%, my condition is met and instruction is assumed not to be needed.<br />

<p>Needs Analysis Evaluation and Need for Instruction<br />
The data from the two data collection surveys indicate that the service members test above the threshold outlined in the instructional goal statement. This could indicate a few things: one, the surveys were inconsistent with the current conditions and may need revision. Secondly, if the instruments used for data collection were indeed accurate to specified requirements, we may have a situation where the instructional goal needs to be rewritten or that service members may already meet the desired level of electrical safety and knowledge.<br />
Instructional Goal Statement<br />
10 Service members on my base will be able to score a 70% or higher combined on both the qualitative survey and quantitative “true/false” exam which will indicate that the service member has a base level of understanding of electrical knowledge and safety. This basic knowledge will be acquired through an instructional curriculum which will allow the service member to score higher on the same test after administration of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Good afternoon,<br />
I’m conducting a survey to measure the amount of interest a person has in their understanding of electrical knowledge as well as whether or not that person has an understanding of electrical safety to protect themselves and their belongings from danger.<br />
Do you have 10 minutes of your time to answer these quick questions? If so, please continue reading.<br />
I will ask you 5 questions. Of the five questions, if you feel you have no interest in answering the question at all or if you feel you don’t have enough information to answer in a comfortable manner, you are 100% allowed and encouraged to either say “I don’t know” or “I don’t care to answer”.<br />
Either will suffice, but all I ask is that you clearly differentiate between not knowing due to a lack of understanding and not caring to answer due to a lack of interest.<br />
If you are ready to answer, may we begin?<br />
1) Please explain or elaborate your understanding of how electricity works</p>

<p>2) What are some basic procedures you have in place to ensure the safety of your electronic equipment, say for example, like your phone?</p>

<p>3) Often times in movies when a scene shows a live electrical wire exposed to water, we assume that the scene is indicating danger. Can you explain why there is any danger in the first place?</p>

<p>4) Electricity is all around us. It powers many gadgets and tools we take for granted. Can you think of anything that you could not do without if electricity were not available to you?</p>

<p>5) What are some things you can do to protect yourself from potential electrical hazards?</p>

<p>Electrical Safety and Knowledge Quiz</p>

<p>TRUE OR FALSE<br />
1) True / False Only qualified electricians are to perform basic electrical safety procedures.<br />
2) True / False A circuit breaker provides electrical protection by shutting itself off when the flow of electricity is over a specific amount.<br />
3) True / False Shock is the only electrical hazard one must be concerned with.<br />
4) True / False The wire attached to your power tools is the best place for your hands to hold it.<br />
5) True / False There is no difference between an outside electrical cord and an inside electrical cord.<br />
6) True / False I should use water to put out a small electrical fire.<br />
7) True / False An electrical insulator makes it almost impossible for electricity to flow through it.<br />
8) True / False The first thing you should do when you see an incapacitated person with live electrical wire is to pull him or her to safety.<br />
9) True / False Water is the only danger I should be concerned with when dealing with potentially dangerous electrical situations<br />
10) True / False As long as my phone still charges, the nicked and frayed, and exposed wiring on my phone charging cord is completely fine.</p>
