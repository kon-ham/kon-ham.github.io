I"¬<p>Hereâ€™s the thing. I love Chik-fil-a. Theyâ€™re good. Customer service is good. Food quality is good. Iâ€™ve never had a bad experience with Chik-fil-a, minus the long lines Iâ€™d have to wait.</p>

<p>But hereâ€™s the <em>other</em> thing. Chik-fil-a sauce is too good. In fact, itâ€™s too good, it overpowers everything else.</p>

<p>Try dipping a celery stick in Chik-fil-a sauce. All you taste is sauce. Try dipping the same celery stick in bufffalo-sauce. Itâ€™s different. Itâ€™s <em>complementary</em>. Thereâ€™s a reason why ranch sauce is King (or Queen) when it comes to dipping veggies that nobody likes. Ranch, though yes, mostly overpowering, is <em>complementary.</em> Itâ€™s not overpowering. (Though, Iâ€™m sure some would argue that ranch sauce is also, overpowering.) But never mind the culinary opinions.</p>

<p>My question, within the framework of leadership is â€“ are you overpowering others with the awesomeness of your sauce? Or are you complimenting the strengths of others with the complementary taste of your sauce?</p>

<p>Are you so eager to express the subtle hints of your flavors that youâ€™re overpowering the meal as a whole? Or are you complementary, adding surprises to each bite, as a person explores the meal and not the flavors in and of themselves?</p>

<p>Some days call for Chik-fil-a sauce. Some days call for complimentary sauce. Like beef au jus sauce, for example.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a difference!</p>
